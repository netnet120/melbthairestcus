I've been here a few times and the food is always delicious.  Pictured here is the Chicken Satay that I had for entree, and the Chicken Fried Rice for...the main meal.  Both were very good.  I would say the service was a little slow.  They, like many other places, annoyingly concentrate on take out orders first, and now that Uber Eats exists, this just adds to the backlog of orders to get out.  Therefore, if you're sitting at the restaurant, you end up waiting much longer than usual while they fulfil those first.  Frustrating, but as long as you're not in a rush, then I guess there's more time to chat with your friends.
The decor is simple but pretty and there's a lot of street parking outside so usually pretty easy to get a parking space.  Overall, I would come here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai meal out.More",Date of visit: May 2019,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I was taken here by a friend on a Saturday night. It was her second visit that week, my first visit ever. We arrived after having had a...meal elsewhere so just had desserts (mango ice-cream and fried bananas with ice-cream) and drank water. As the restaurant was not full, we were able to sit over our food for a long time while we enjoyed talking, and the staff did not pressure us to leave. The restaurant premises are quite spacious. The tables for two are along one wall with a banquette and are close together, not the best if you were seeking romantic privacy. From what I could see of the printed menu and blackboard specials, the meals are not innovative.More",Date of visit: May 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

However this place is perfectly satisfactory, with a decent menu, offering tofu & vegetable in all curries for...vegetarians (unlike most Thai restaurants).  We tried the vegetable curry puffs, which were delicious, & on request, served with peanut sauce rather than the provided thai chilli sauce. They were small compared to those elsewhere, but there were 4 to the serve, which was good. My husband tried the fish cakes which were apparently 'yum'. We then tried the gang massamum curry with tofu & veggies, which was a little more watery than I am used to, but delicious nevertheless. Husband tried the chilli sesame pork dish which was good, but did not have enough chilli in it to give it any kick. The garlic roti with peanut sauce was flaky & moreish, & a good side dish for the meal along with the usual coconut rice. The only negative to the meal was the less than optimal service, with only two girls working the floor, but they can perhaps be forgiven for underestimating how many of us didn't want to cook on this freezing cold, rainy Winter's night! It's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but we would recommend this restaurant & we will definitely visit again.More",Date of visit: July 2015,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Satays and wraps appeared reheated and the chicken was dry and cold in the centre. Ordered the beef lemongrass stir fry and fried rice both came out in 5  minutes and the stir fry looked like it had been re heated and was a stew. The chicken fried rice was cold and warm in parts and dry. The place was packed and had heaps of takeaway orders but only a few in the kitchen so it was not possible to freshly cook the meals and get them out that quick.

I've found if you want their food at its best, eat in. The quality and serve size can't be beat. The service in the restaurant isn't bad either. 

The restaurant itself is a bit...run-of-the-mill when it comes to finishing and decor. Nothing special. It's all easy washed, fast food oriented. But the space isn't loud, so you'll be able to have a conversation while eating with your friends no problem. 

The take-away is a bit hit and miss though. Delivery times vary through menulog, and be careful as I have had them completely lose my order. The food seems to lose its taste a little too when being prepped for take away. But it still is good. 

*caution* - the spice level in this food sits more akin to traditional Thai. Ordering a curry in the restaurant, the 'mild' option is likely to be a little too on the spicy side for some still.More",Date of visit: September 2017,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This place has beautiful ambience with a wall mural, lighting and seating arrangements. Big tick!
Menu no by large which makes ordering easy but also means what they do prepare...is of the highest quality. 
We ordered chicken pad Thai, massaman curry, story fry with cashews and chilli jam plus entrees of paint sauce with roti, sprinkled by rolls and chicken wings. 
Portion sizes were large and the food so tasty. Service from one waitress was fast, efficient and very friendly. 
Parking can be challenging but at night much easier. Hood disabled access. Toilets on site. 
Dietaries well catered for. Price matches the quality.

"Authentic Thai Taste, Great Vibe and Star Service",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g1078374-d15062564-r784107286-Panna_Thai-Fitzroy_Yarra_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/b6/20/5b/caption.jpg,Frank13S,5 reviews,Reviewed 7 March 2021 ,"Let me start by saying I am a Thai Food fanatic, to the point that I can reference (in fact in preference to English!) many of their dishes by their native Thai names.

And I have had Thai food in Thailand itself as well as...in Thai food hotspots around South East Asia.  

I can say that this venue delivers the closest authentically leaning flavour profile (in a Western country) outside Thailand itself and its neighbouring South East Asia Thai-towns”.

Served piping hot, the food in this place is extraordinarily sumptuous and scrumptious and truly authentically seasoned to the pungent taste of freshly harvested Thai herbs!

Stand out dishes: Gaeng Keow Wan Gai (Green Curry Chicken), Tom Yum Goong (Hot Sour Prawn Soup), Pad Thai stir fried rice noodles and Sizzling Beef Stir Fry on a hotplate.

Lovely standout drink: Fresh coconut Juice on crushed ice which comes with the meat of young coconut. My favourite!

Ambience and vibe is like that of a nice Latin club with cool club-like music pumping along in the background.

They have a loyalty card as well where you get a free entree as a reward.

Last but not least, the service is top shelf ... you are made to feel very comfortable and pampered ... like a Thai King...

Timely service and what’s more, ever attentive, super friendly and obliging service as well, especially from their ever smiling, disarmingly charming and cheerfully sweet-natured angelic-faced young waitress, “Sai”.

She is so gentle and lovely to all the customers, both regulars and new.

Thank you Sai, for making my time here so enjoyable!

Charm has been here in a little unpretentious restaurant for many years...and is further evidence of its sumptuous meals and value.
My Mum and partner joined me and each was similarly complimentary about our shared soft shell crab, Money bags and Fish cake starters followed by Massaman curry, duck curry and a type of seafood medley - all delicious.
The service is friendly, casual and mostly attentive - what you expect of a local and probably family run business, but the chef is fantastic.
Should you have to wait a while, you get to show your creative side by using the supplied crayons to draw some master pieces on the placemats.

On arrival we were met with a friendly face at the empty restaurant (6pm) and although there was a language barrier with the waitress, we went...on to order drinks, a few small starters and two mains. 

To begin, we had the scallops (1 each) which was the highlight of the order, followed by a small vegetarian salad (tofu) which had light flavours. 

The mains we ordered were the King Prawn Salad which consisted of about 10 prawns, and iceberg lettuce with flavours - not something that would fill most as a main! The second main item was a Tofu Sizzler plate with veges. Basic flavours of oyster sauce  mixed with large portions of tofu and a small amount of veges (onion, oyster mushrooms and capsicum). The bonus was that they had RED rice (called brown rice on the menu) which is very nutritious and hard to find in Melbourne - plus it was cooked to perfection. 

All in all, the food was average from the perspective of a couple that have both spent large amounts of time in Thailand, and sure there are better places to be found. However, it did fill the gap and the prices were very reasonable.More",Date of visit: November 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The vegetable spring rolls for entree were cold in the middle, the Chicken Red curry had no depth of flavour...(suspect it was a packet paste with coconut cream that was sickly) nor any discernible herbs and the Phad Thai with soft shell crab was honestly inedible (and I am not fussy and will eat anything).  It was made with thin round noodles, not the typical flat noodles, and only had the addition of a few fried tofu pieces.  It was heavily coated in a thick (to be fair nice flavour) sauce but the whole thing was so gluggy we thought we were going to choke eating it - so we didn't.

They had recently conducted a menu leaflet letter box drop and decided to give them a go.
We ordered a...number of dishes the usual Chicken Spring Rolls, Roti Bread with Satay sauce (sauce was bland), Yellow Curry Chicken and Crispy Pork with Chinese Broccoli. The stand out dish was the soft shell crab with the Apple Salad giving a lovely zing to the dish. The Pad Thai was a little bitter (we like it a little sweeter) and only two prawns were found in the dish however the fish pieces were large and very tasty. All the other dishes were basic Thai and nothing to rave about and pricey for what you get.
Obviously some of the taste was compromised by the delivery time transit; it was a little limp, cold and lack lustre by the time it had arrived - acceptable under the circumstances.
We eat Thai very often and try a different place as we hear or are recommended one or discover them for ourselves. However we can get tastier and better value for money from our favourite and local Thai restaurant only 5 mins up the road, with the food not being severely affected by delivery times.
Would I try again? Probably not but give it a go and decide for yourself.

I had Pad Thai which I can thoroughly recommend, while someone else on the table had been before and reordered the green mango salad with fish which I tasted and it was divine.

For the price it...wasn’t where near worth it.  Not on my list to return.

The only minor issues we had was the 1.5 hour seating duration was too short. 2 hours would be...better. Also the greeting at the front door was less than friendly, but they may have been having a bad day.

Service was slow and we had the ask for our drinks after we waited 20 minutes. Then 2 out of 4 drinks arrived and 5 minutes later the others arrived.

Would give it another go and hope the service and greeting improves.More",Date of visit: February 2022,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I took this to mean that the food is genuine.

You order at the counter and then they bring the food to the table. I was unsure...about the heat level to answer and so went Medium.  This worked fine for us. 

The Pad Thai was excellent and nicely spiced.

The Thai beef salad was a disappointment. It is normally a salad with thin pieces of seasoned beef spread through it. The one here was a number of small squarish pieces of beef at the bottom of the bowl with a few bits of salad on top. The beef was seasoned, but rather chewy.  My main complaint is that it did not taste like a normal Thai salad. It lacked the mix of tastes I would have expected. There was no crunch of the ground toasted rice to be felt.

I would return but order something different as my second choiceMore",Date of visit: June 2022,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food is very good (esp the beef masaman) and the creative drinks and deserts really set it apart from anything else in Melbourne.

But there is a problem. Staffing. Firstly the staff are really unfriendly which is...the opposite of what you want when you are choosing this place because of its fun factor.

Secondly, the only person capable of making the cotton candy drinks and resets is the head chef. What should have been a 90 min meal (max) took us 3 hours!!! Our drinks which we ordered as soon as we sat down too OVER 2 hours to reach our table!!

I really want to recommend this place to friends but I wouldn’t want them to endure such a wait.

Son In Law - @whatepieats Review,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d8633649-r617834023-Son_In_Law-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",whatepieats,246 reviews,Reviewed 19 September 2018 ,"Son in Law is a more casual dining style Thai restaurant tucked in the Collingwood, corner of Johnston street.
This restaurant brings the new concept of Thai restaurant with fresh looking, modern, attractive and colourful design.
The place is quite spacious, they have indoor and...outdoor, courtyard seating.

The customer service was very friendly and nice serving all customers with good manner.
The ambience was really good and very cosy. 
The price of drinks and food was reasonable.

We ordered:
- Thai Ice Matcha Milk Tea for $4.50
The Thai Ice Matcha Milk Tea served creatively in the unique light bulb shaped cups.
The taste of matcha was great, but it was too sweet.

- Tom Yum Soup (spicy) *Carrot, onion, coriander, tomato, kaffir lime leaf musroom with chicken for $10.00
We loved the tom yum soup! Though the portion wasn't really generous for this price but the taste was absolutely fantastic and refreshing - it was totally worth it.
The tom yum had balance taste and the sour flavour was just right on the spot.
We reckoned that this dish was one of the best Tom Yum soup we've ever had.
We couldn't stop having this one **have a look in the photo, the soup was getting less and less LOL

- Chicken Pad Thai (VO) for $15.00
Chicken Pad Thai was served freshed, noodle was cooked perfectly.
Unfortunately, the overall taste of chicken Pad Thai was under our expectation.
It had an average taste definitely not the best we've ever tried.
Sadly yo say that It was a let down :(

- Lunch special deal (main dish + rice), Twice Cooked Crispy Pork Belly *Oyster sauce, gai lan (Chinese broccoli) for $14.00
Food presentation was great and very appealing.
The portion was really generous and the crispy pork belly was perfectly cooked.
Everything was cooked perfectly, it had a perfect balance taste.

** Lunch special deal is really recommended, good value of money

Overall, we still enjoyed having our lunch in Son in Law and will come back.
We really want to try the Rainbow fairy floss milk drinks as many people ordered this and it was really appealing.

Service: 4.0
Taste: 4.0
Price: 3.0
Speed: 3.5

Yay: Twice Cooked Crispy Pork Belly was great
Nay: Pad Thai, Thai Ice Matcha Milk Tea was super sweetMore",Date of visit: October 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Great food, couldn't fault it. they cater to gluten free and vegie. The portions are moderate, except the rice is tiny considering the price. It has the cute melting characters and the awesome fairy floss. S you...think you'd have a great time? NO WAY. 
We booked a table and we're first in the restaurant for dinner. We ordered mains and desert and fairy floss. The waitress treated me like I was stupid. She got the order wrong, twice.... The food came out one plate every 15 minutes, so we sat there watching one person eat at a time, and the last dish came out 1 hour after we ordered it. But it tasted and looked great. Then the melting character deserts came out. then we sat, and sat, and sat... while we waited for the fairy floss. 
We watched multiple tables fill up, watched them get their multiple fairy floss before even their mains, watched them eat, watched them leave..... over and over while we waited..... 1 hour and 45 minutes, 3 reminders and then having to say we're leaving where the hell is it until we got it.

Waited an hour and a half after ordering on Uber Eats today (on mother's Day!)  - after no useful information when we rang when there was no update on the order and having the phone put down on us (!) I...went down there to see where our order was. Absolutely hopeless. The lady had no idea what was going on, the kitchen seemed completely overwhelmed and she didn't try to work out where my order was INSTEAD STARTED TAKING OTHER CUSTOMERS ORDERS OVER THE PHONE! 
I was flabbergasted at  this total lack of understanding of customer service. Finally when she understood our order was through Uber she apologized because they were essentially ignoring Uber orders!! Over an hour and a half wasted including my time of 15 minutes waiting inside the restaurant for an order which was NEVER GOING UP FULFILLED!!
My elderly mother was waiting in the car and my young children were waiting for dinner at home. 
I have to say I could not believe the situation. A complete lack of understanding of customer service. We went over the road and got a pizza in 25 mins.

The room is quite pleasant (what’s happened to the shrine to...the king that used to be ubiquitous?) and the menu is standard Thai and the food, although a bit bland, certainly met our admittedly modest expectations.

It was the service which sticks in the memory, and that is probably not the fault of our wait staff, whose manner was very pleasant but her English limited and experience even more so. It became one of those ‘what could go wrong next’ evenings: our request for a bottle of wine and two glasses meant we got two glasses of wine, the dishes arrived in the wrong order, we were overcharged..you get the idea. It wasn’t our serving staff’s fault: more some laziness in supervision. A memorable night for the wrong reasons.More",Date of visit: December 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The place was full with people from  the university and hospitals.  Clearly the place simply doesnt care about its patrons.  To be fair on the staff they were run off their feet but really this is no excuse because they knew...how many had booked.  It took a long time to take our order.  The food came in dribs and drabs, some people were served 30 min after others.  They got orders wrong because they were rushing to take the order.  The food was ordinary quality.  The serve sizes were very small.  I say it again it is clear this restaurant doesnt care about its clients.More",Date of visit: June 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Taste of the food very poor, very little flavour and everything was in...very big junks and just with seasonal western vegetables. The Pad Thai I had was totally flavourless, the green curry had a slight touch of flavour.

I concluded, waste of money and time, beside hungry to get some nice food after all the effort

On a recent visit we agreed that we had never had...a bad meal here.  Yes, the service can vary, but the food is always good and as it's still BYO, an evening here is good value.

The night we were there consisted of two big tables - a hen's night and a birthday group.  Although it was noisy, we still had our order taken and received our meal in acceptable timeframes.  We had the curry puffs and the prawns wrapped n spring roll wrappers to start.  Both were great.  As was our pad thai with prawn and a yellow beef curry.

Last night it was off to Gusto House with...the family - 5 adults and a 2 1/2 year old (going on 5) granddaughter.       

An excellent night of dining followed.    Starters of money bags (possibly the best money bags I have tasted), curry puffs, prawn spring rolls, veg dumplings (outstanding) and chicken dumpling for the little one.    Had to order a second serve of the chicken dumplings as she devoured them with her rice.     Most of the starters only have 2 pieces,  but they are a good size and so delicious.  

Mains were an excellent crispy pork, stir fry duck, green curry and the fabulous 3 seasoned fish - an outstanding dish with crispy kaffir lime leaves.    We also shared a good Thai fried rice with numerous large butterflied prawns.   

Gusto is BYO wine and the young ladies who serve are friendly and attentive and really want you to enjoy your night.

My friends are apologising profusely and by this stage it is obvious they forgot my meal altogether. I ask a waitress again and get the same reply, 30 minutes of waiting a d it comes out and another waitress tells me as she puts it down that it was late because of a deep fried potato on the side!

No apology, nothing.

Local Thai doesn't reach these heights that often.  This restaurant gets the key things spot on.  The food is always wonderful.  The service is always wonderful.  And, most amazing of all, it's rarely crowded.  Two reasons.  First, it's at the southern...end of the strip.  Second, it's actually hard to find.  I've been coming here for years and I somehow managed to go past it yesterday because it's so subtly located.  

Now, don't just take my word that it's a great place.  Chat to my companion James from last night.  He's a magnificent cook.  He loves it here.  We both almost passed out on tasting the sheer magnificence of the red duck curry.  All other dishes were wonderful too.

You are in very safe hands here.  The food is great.  The service is wonderfully friendly.  Prices are also fantastic.

Was a few minutes late but that was it. Ordered the $17.50 duck curry and $17.50 Massaman Curry. WOEFULLY DISAPPOINTING does not come close to describing it. One piece of duck in a massive container that is 1/4 full of sauce...with the duck being significantly overcooked. What is more disgraceful, is the under cooked sweat potato and overcooked Massaman lamb curry, that I received 6 pieces (8 if you include the 2 pieces of sweet potato). The meat for both the duck and lamb are barely edible and 200% does not warrant charging $17.50 each. Needless to say I won't be ordering from this place again and I advise all patrons to stay clear as there are plenty other Thai places in the area that offers #1 better food and #2 better value for money. I think this establishment are taking the piss for what should be good Thai food just because of the area that they are in and the quality just isn't there - I would rate them 0 stars if I could, literally the worst Thai food I have had in the South East suburbs in Melbourne.

The only saving grace is we did order through Menulog and they issued a refund, after contacting the store to confirm they were happy with issuing a full refund - I did call the store before contacting Menulog and the lady advised that we would need to contact Menulog for a full refund as the store couldn't issue one (complete BS).More",Date of visit: January 2020,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Some favorites are the barramundi with apple slaw salad, pad Thai and seafood Tom kha soup. I’ve been to Thailand 12 times and done an authentic cooking course - so usually I avoid Thai restaurants in Australia because I’m disappointed. Not here....The pad Thai is tasty with all the complex flavors it is meant to have rather than the plate of bland mushy noodles many Thai places serve up. It’s also licensed and BYO and the friendly staff work hard to accommodate dietary requirements. Also a night out here won’t empty your bank account.More",Date of visit: June 2019,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Actually popular with Thai's.  That says something.
I was so looking forward to Pad Thai noodles with prawns & chicken.  My favourite there.
It...was so disappointed.  
I knew something wasn't right when l mixed the lime juice and chilli flakes in.  The whole mixture didn't have the usual soft texture.  It was like a big lump.
Eating it wasn't enjoyable either.  It really lacked flavour and was very bland.
The chicken looked like it was thrown in as an after thought.  It was dry and chewy.
I asked the waitress if they had changed anything.  She said no.  I told her about my lunch and she just said she would tell the chef.
I was disappointed that they didn't seem to care either.
Sad to see a once good place gone downhill.  
Don't think l'll be going back.More",Date of visit: September 2018,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I agree with some of the other reviews in that the chilli kick isn't prevalent in the food, BUT, easily solved by asking for extra chilli! As other flavours are all spot on....They are in the process of getting their liquor license so at the moment it's BYO wine and beer. But they advised they will stock a vast range of Thai craft beers very shortly, which will be a great selling point I think. 

Nice service and very quick too, food was delicious and filling. Will keep this place in mind for our lazy Friday nights for sure!

Service and food was down a bit about 2 years ago but they have changed hands and it is fabulous now. Tom yum veg has great flavour (you can add heat as you want), it isn't a large serve but...is more than enough with a main. Mains are all good - you can't pick a bad dish - stir fries, pad thai, curries are all fantastic. Very few thai restaurants in Melbourne can match it. Mussaman curry the best I have had. Waiters are polite, smiling and lovely to talk to. Quality is always consistent. So great to have such a great local Thai place. Specials are nice as well. Entrees are yum - veg spring rolls, chicken satay always great. Thanks guys, see you again soon!! We struggle to finish with 2 or 3 entrees and 4 main dishes for 4 people so quantity is spot on, value is excellent. We don't drink a lot of alcohol so the bill is always very reasonable.More",Date of visit: July 2019,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Disappointing and over-priced,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g261658-d2314940-r553846291-Thai_Terrace_Restaurant-Kew_Boroondara_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Eliza L,1 review,Reviewed 15 January 2018 ,"We finally tried Thai Terrace after many years of living in the area and had hoped it would be a good local for us. Unfortunately not!

The staff were polite but the menu is very overpriced for what they are offering, in quality and quantity....I know food costs are expensive and profit margins tight, which is a tough balancing act for any business.
We spent just shy of $90 for dinner for two, excluding beverages, and had three entrees, one main with steamed rice and two desserts.

Prawn spring roll entree is $12.90.
For this we received four small prawns wrapped in spring roll pastry with watered down sweet chilli sauce on the side (which I'm 99% sure was store bought) and no herbs, lettuce or anything fresh to accompany and lift the dish. The prawns were not even seasoned or marinated in anything before being wrapped. That's $3.22 per prawn
Again for the samosas ($11.90 for four) and the chicken satay ($12.90 for five very small skewers)- no herbs or any 'fresh' accompaniment and the satay sauce was slightly thinned peanut butter lacking that delicious hint of chilli and lift of fish sauce and tamarind.

We also tried a main special of crispy pork at $19.90, which was recommended by the waitress. There was very little pork (my guess, 80-100g, very thinly sliced) and you could tell the meat was of low quality. The dish was extended out with carrots and beans. Again, no herbs or any garnish to help 'freshen' the dish, which, let's be honest, you expect from Thai cuisine. It's all about the balance of heat, oil and fresh herbs & vegetables. You could also taste that the chef had flamed the pan too much whilst cooking, so it had that horrible metallic taint to the dish.

We tried dessert- pandan custard crepes and banana samosas. Small serves, although I wouldn't have wanted more, and the price point was far more accurate at $7.90 each. Taste was pleasant enough but I don't want my dessert 'garnished' with watered down store bought chocolate topping and there was very little banana in the samosas- mainly just spring roll pastry. Crepes were very egg-y, but that's to be expected.

Unfortunately there's much better places in the area.
It wasn't that the food was terrible. It was just overpriced for the quality and quantity of the serves.

The online reviews are very mixed so I was a little reluctant but also happy to try somewhere new. 

Sadly the negative reviews were spot on. This was just...disappointing all round. 

I’ll start with the food. Below average and certainly not cheap. The green chicken curry was $18 (about right) but was watery and bland. The sizzling beef was much better but at $23 it should be. The spicy lamb was $22 but had a rather overpowering taste to it. Portion sizes were fine. 

The spring rolls were fine. The chicken satay was ok. The calamari I can only described as being like a deep fried giraffes tongue. Large, thick and chewy. No subtlety at all. As soon as you bit into them the batter slid off. Tasteless. 

Despite asking for rice for all three of us we were presented with one tiny portion so we had to ask for two more. 

The roti bread was tiny but tasty. 

The Thai coffee was nine parts ice, one part coffee. My teenage son was appalled at how little liquid there was. 

The glass of Shiraz was good though. 

Service: as others have commented, this is non existent, bordering on shockingly bad and rude. We were there for two hours and spent $125. Not once did we receive a smile or anything remotely approaching warmth or politeness. Food and drinks were simply placed on the table and the waitress walked off. The two ladies seemed far more interested in eating their food or spending time in front of their laptop. 

I’m struggling to recall any restaurant or cafe where the service was so consistently awful. Seriously people, if interacting with people is so difficult for you then perhaps a career in the service industry is not for you. 

Maybe we caught them on a bad night but I doubt it. There are plenty of other reviews to suggest our experience was not unique. 

We certainly won’t be back - there are much better places in Sandrigham, Hampton or Black Rock with good food and way better service.More",Date of visit: July 2019,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

To dine in, the decor of the restaurant is just so well done and lovely....What're more is they offer a huge amount of options and the portions they serve are massive. For the price I'm so happy with the quality of food as well everything I've had here is delicious. The staff are friendly and quick (they have to be given the amount of uber orders they have to juggle along with dine-in customers).

"Average, very average. ",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g580504-d23092480-r792747226-Little_Bangkok_Doncaster-Doncaster_Manningham_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Wengsoon,30 reviews,Reviewed 16 June 2021 ,"I'm writing this review acknowledging that their food is perhaps above average, with lots of room for improvement. Now, based entirely on Food alone, will I return, NO. Would I recommend it to a friend, perhaps, because it may be good enough for some ....Let me qualify.  I'm originally from South East Asia and have been to Thailand many many times. I know, it's not fair to compare to actual Thai food in Thailand. But I had a reference point, so it's hard to totally ignore my reference point. 

the Food: as described above, is almost there, something short here, something more short there, if you know what I mean. The food presentation looked good tho, looks delicious, just not really that delish when you actually taste it. 

the Service: this is what peeved me off the most. I felt very little care is given to how we are served. Heck, I'm NOT a Fine Dining kinda guy, but their service really sucked. They don't bother to ensure our rice order (2 pots) was delivered, instead, they served us a few bowls to share out, and we had to ask them for more rice (which I emphasize, not according to order), like our order of Tom Kah (white tomyum like chicken) which came in 2 ""Hot Pot"" style pots, and just a small Chinese style soup spoon as serving spoon. Usually, if the food comes in a Pot, I'd expect a larger soup ladle like serving spoon, but No, it came with 1 small soup spoon, for the whole pot of Tom Kah (soupy/gravy type of dish). So, we asked them if they perhaps have a different serving spoon, and they returned with a normal spoon. And many other things that seem like they don't really care, as long as we vacate the spot by 7:30pm, which they emphasized a few times (and they didn't look like they're having a busy night (mid week evening). 

So, overall, the food presentation was ok, it costed about $500 for our family get together meal, which we didn't expect fine dining (just good efficient service). Compounded by averagely OK food, inadequate common sense service, I can't give this more than 2 out of 5 rating. I would NEVER return to this place, unless it's a family gathering and someone INSIST in going by there, not by my own choice (we came here because sister ""Birthday"" lady wanted Thai). 

And finally, the value is below average. At roughy $46 per pop, for basically quite rudimentary dishes, I'd say not good value. 

PS: their Tom Kah and Prawn Mung been noodle was good.More",Date of visit: June 2021,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Greeted by owner who is friendly and only too happy to please.  Family run business.  Restaurant is clean, bright and inviting.  Ordered and entrees delivered quickly, steaming hot and fresh. Mains which ate ridiculously generous for what you fork...out, were delicious. Fresh ingredients, tasty and very filling. We ordered, squid, a chicken dish and tofu- all amazing.  Ordered some extra tofu to take home with rice - 4 of us ate, drank for under $80.  Great value for money and the best hosts. Chef also greeted us as we left. She is an awesome cook.

Ordered, had great hospitality but then got back to the motel and all I can say was disappointment and beyond. Lemongrass beef had maybe 10 fatty bits of meat with about 750mls of what I can...describe as a gravy like sauce with absolutely no hint oemon grass. The Roti bread was chewy and almost inedible and the peanut sauce that went with it was absolutely salty and inedible. Contacted the owner, the bread is an in house recipe and absolutely no apology for that and the peanut sauce. He blamed his new chef and offered a refund only on the lemon grass beef. Would not order takeaway ever again from here. Do not waste your time.More",Date of visit: January 2020,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This is a largish Vietnamese Thai restaurant on busy High St.  I was served quickly and the food also came out very rapidly.  I loved the prawn and beef rice paper rolls.  As good as I’ve has for a while and...with a nice little kick from the Vietnamese mint.  Good peanut sauce too.  The beef salad wasn’t as polished though.  The veggies were a bit roughly cut and it wasn’t quite as flavoursome as I’d been hoping.  And, the beef was a little chewy.  Although, I was starting to rethink the dish by the end as it grew on me throughout and I was left with lovely warm lips by the end.  I also loved the chopped nuts through it.  You couldn’t complain about the size of the serve though.  It was huge.  I quite liked the place though and would happily come here again.  It’s not Victoria St but also not Victoria St prices.  I reckon it was 20-30% cheaper here.  To repeat, I’d very happily come again.More",Date of visit: May 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The restaurant was empty yet the hostess enquired if we had a reservation..........

As many do, we ordered the fish cakes and satay chicken for entree and the Massaman curry and Spicy Salted Prawns...for mains. The Fish cakes were spongy and tasted off. Put us off dinner completely. A quick trip to the bathroom was an eye opener as stock was scattered all over the place on route to the bathroom, which was not exactly clean. 

We were ill that night and when I politely pointed this out to the owner I got this comical response. 

“Firstly I would I apologized for that and letting us know, our food is freshly prepared and cook to order. The fish cake might be over cooked we appologised for this it ruin your dinner night outht be o,ver cook that why is stale, we sold many served of Massaman, spicy and salt prawn on tuesday”

“Spicy and salt prawn could make your stomach sick because it hot, massaman curry is sweet and bit sour this might make you your stomach sick.  Once again thank you you to let us known and I would take this opportunity to closely monitor our staffs and improve everything possibly we can”. 

So as someone who relished spicy food and has practically grown up eating curries, somehow eating the fact that I ate salted spicy prawns and a very Mild Massaman curry are now considered unsafe and may cause sick stomachs. 

1/10

Can’t serve dodgy Thai fish cakes and blame the customer. No good.More",Date of visit: March 2021,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We chose entrees and mains which arrived promptly. I enjoyed my chicken Massaman curry but didn't go for my wife's chicken sates. Yes, the peanut sauce is lovely but the chicken seemed to have  sour taste inside, as if it had been cooked from frozen. 
We didn't stay very much longer and experienced no smiles or personal greeting on our departure. I'd like to think it was just an off night.

The large woks are constantly turning out the food Thai street vendors do so wonderfully well. Not all dishes are hot, but when you ask for your food to...have chilli heat, watch out! Not for the faint-hearted.
Seating for about 30 is basic, four seats per table. Regulars abound, either seated, or take-away.
Prices are reasonable, my favourite Pad Thai is $11.00, and I struggle to finish it. Pretty extensive menu.
This is not Royal Thai cuisine, but excellent, honest Thai cooking. Have found all staff friendly and smiling, as Thai people have become renowned world wide.

I produced a receipt with the date showing less than a fortnight ago. I asked not for a refund but if this soup...could be added to my new order. The woman implied that I was lying by telling me that I was making up the story to get a free soup and said I was dishonest, refusing to add a soup that I had already paid for. I told her that I had incorrect orders before but never followed them up, this was the first because I had kept the receipt. So basically if they make an error you pay for it - you lose and they win.

I then called back to ask if I could just pick up the meal instead. It then took 10 minutes to communicate this aswell. The woman could not understand that I had just called and ordered over the phone, she kept mistaking me for an ubereats order or for someone that wanted to order takeaway. FINALLY she understood and said that yes I could come pick it up instead and it wouldn’t be ready in 15 minutes. Meaning it would be ready 20 minutes from when I ordered, 40 minutes from when I started the phone call. 5 minutes later I head over and pick up the food and they give me the $5 delivery fee back in coins. Once I’m home again, the food is the completely wrong order. Absolutely nothing I ordered was in the bag and all the food was cold. My family were starving because by this time it was 8.30 and I tried to call the restaurant but there phone was disconnected and so we started to dig in anyway. 10 minutes later I get a phone call to ask my to bring back the order I picked up because they gave me the wrong one. Absolutely no apologies were made, I tried to explain that we had already started eating and that I was very disappointed but yet again they could not understand me over the phone. So frustrating.

Went to the King & I with friends on a week night - good location and based on the menu should have been OK. They don't have a liquor licence but you can to bring...your own. Although we booked I don't think it is necessary on a night early in the week.

Our starters were quite nice - no complaints - from a mix and included some tasty fish cakes.

Main course is where we felt the restaurant really let themselves down. We had a green curry, which I suspect was from a suspect packet and thrown together in just a few minutes. It was more of a green curry soup, with crinkle cut carrots (amongst other items you'd not see in a decent green curry.) Our expectations weren't that high, but knowing how easy it is to make something like this at home, you'd at least expect that standard.

Other main courses were just as un inspiring. Service was OK 

No need to revisit and I couldn't recommend it.More",Date of visit: September 2018,2  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

But they had nearly finished, and left soon after we had arrived. 
After that, we were the only eat-in diners all evening, which felt really, really strange, for a fairly large...restaurant, AND on a Friday night. There were several take-aways picked up, but no other diner arrived to eat in.
But, apart from that, we were really impressed with the service (okay, we were the only diners), and with the food that night. 
We selected their featured special of Deep-Fried Barramundi with ginger and shallots, and that was just delicious. Even the avowed non-fish-eater amongst us tried it, and then took several more pieces of fish! The Green Curry was amazingly rich and flavoursome, and the Caramalised (sic!) Pork Belly was also tasty and its accompanying salad was an exciting explosion of flavours.
The sticky rice was served in a very cute little woven basket.
For three people, three mains plus rice (coconut and sticky) was more than enough food.
Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience; the decor is mostly understated and elegant, and, apart from the wine, the meal was not as expensive as expected.More",Date of visit: January 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Somewhat romantic were my memories of the ambiance and cuisine.

What I can say, is very little has changed; I did note new power conduits which probably meant the old girl has been re-wired.  So fair to say,...she's a little tired.

The propensity is to deep fry the dished, so it lacks subtle finesse and those wonderful Thai flavours.

Staff were friendly and professional.

Delightful family meal in a peaceful restaurant at the end of a working day,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g970303-d5091932-r473704810-A_Taste_of_Siam_Restaurant-Hampton_Bayside_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Peter S,549 reviews,Reviewed 9 April 2017 ,"A Taste of Siam, Hampton

It was Monday evening and our favourite local Thai restaurant was closed; a quick search showed that the Taste of Siam in Hampton was open. We made a reservation for a table in the window, and arrived for 7.45 pm....There were three tables already occupied – half dozen people; 10% full. But Monday evenings are always a good time to find a quiet place to eat. Our first time there – and some highly favourable first impressions
The welcome smile helped, but so did the atmosphere of pastel colours, the quietness of the dining room and the light traffic outside on Hampton Street. The restaurant was the only one in a short row of shops that were closed for the night. We could park the car right outside.
There were three of us, and we ordered a beef curry - green, the least spicy version, and the Pad Khing stir-fry with prawn main and ginger and mixed vegetables. Coconut rice and white rice sides complemented the mains. An entrée of vegetable spring rolls (x6) with a sweet chilli sauce served as an appetiser, whilst waiting for the mains. A glass of New Zealand Sauvignon blanc was shared and a can of lemon substituted for the cider which was not available.
Meals were a visual delight and came piping hot; they were a pleasure to eat – the spices of the curry contrasting to the colour presentation of the stir fry. No mixing here, but eaten separately to appreciate the traditional tastes offered.
The meal cost A$65 but, courtesy of our Entertainment Book we had a 25% discount coupon so we paid A$48 – good value for a delicious meal and an hour and half of peaceful banter across the table. 
Exploring the menu; entrees were around A$7-8, soups the same, salads A$12-15, curries A$11-15 (in the range vegetables to seafoods), stir fried plates the same, and noodles a couple of dollars cheaper. BBQed meats were the most expensive at A$13-16, which is one good reason for choosing a cheaper option. The other (with Australians the highest meat eaters on the globe) is health*.  
The Taste of Siam restaurant comes highly recommended.

Totally Fake Thai Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d8802693-r828164300-Blooming_Orchids_Thai_Restaurant-Melbourne_Victoria.html,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,navelpink,1 review,Reviewed 16 February 2022 ,"We tried this restaurant for the first time and certainly the last time on Valentine's Day, which so happens to also be my daughter's birthday. So I thought I would treat them to a Thai meal in close to our home.

I lived in Thailand...for 40 years and have just returned to retire in Australia. My daughters are both half Thai and half Aussie. So we are all quite familiar with how Thai food should taste and be presented.

The restaurant gets one star for the decor and the polite staff. But that's where it ends.

1) We asked for all the food to be delivered at the same time, since that's just the way it's done in Thailand. You don't have starters and then a soup followed by mains. Everything arrives at once and is eaten together. 

The server said, ""Sure, we can do that."" Needless to say, the Prawn Spring Rolls and Chicken in Coconut Soup arrived first, and without even any rice. So we waited and waited for the other dishes, at the very least expecting the rice to come along. But no. So I asked the same server where the rest of the dishes were. Lame excuse, that they are starters, even though I specifically asked for everything to come at once.

The Prawn Spring Rolls were ordinary. The Chicken in Coconut Soup tasted nothing like how the dish is supposed to taste and was sickly sweet. It's a savoury soup, NOT A DESSERT!

The rice arrived. We were all shocked to find that it was also sickly sweet. We weren't asked, which rice we wanted and were served something called ""Coconut Rice""... Fusion food perhaps? But not a Thai dish, to be sure. Not one Thai person I have asked since had ever heard of it. 

Finally, the other dishes we ordered arrived. A stir-fired Hokkien Noodle with beef, which was an odd thing to have on a Thai menu, but the birthday girl wanted to try it. And a Stir-fried Beef with Thai Basil. Both dishes looked very similar. Both were sickly sweet and tasted so similar it wasn't funny. The Stir-fried Beef with Thai Basil even had Hokkien Noodles in it! Meaning that both dishes were cooked in the same sauces and the same pan separated and a few basil leaves and half a chilli thrown in to make the Thai Basil dish sans the proper sauces. Hopeless!

Another interesting point is that none of the staff we interacted with can speak Thai... Not the server whom I believe is also the proprietor, the chef (he served us the stir-fried dishes) nor the bartender/cashier. They all spoke with distinctive Manglish accents.

I also pity the people waiting for takeaway, one chap waited at least the whole time we were there. Another, was so angry at having to wait an hour he gave the cashier a piece of his mind and stormed out.

In summary, this is not a Thai restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. It's trying to masquerade as one, but very poorly done.
The food is certainly not Thai, all the dishes we had were sickly sweet, and we were basically cheated out of a Thai Basil dish but charged for it.

I can't fathom for a minute all of the glowing reviews. Can only suspect that the writers have never had Thai cuisine before.

As The Donald would say... Fake Restaurant.More",Date of visit: February 2022,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Cooked with greens and topped with a fried egg with a runny yolk, this is the best crispy pork belly I've found on Victoria Street - and I've...tried pretty much all of them.
The pork is crisp and crunchy but not overcooked, and the runny yolk is a rarity in the other restaurants around here.
The restaurant appears to have had a change of ownership in recent months - I'm no longer recognised on site (and asked if I'm having the crispy pork) by the same waitress, and the spice level has dropped considerably. On previous visits, the 'medium' spice would have been 'my mouth is dying' in most other places, where as now I'd consider it 'medium spice for asian people' as opposed to 'medium spice for thai people' or 'medium spice for sichuan people'. Order accordingly.More",Date of visit: February 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I ordered the Thai green curry, it is the closest authentic Thai dish that I have had outside of Thailand, it reminded me of Chiang Mai.

The dish was not too creamy at all, something you can expect from...a Thai Aussie dish, it was perfect with mild spice.

The only down side were the beans being a bit wrinkled but for the price, taste and authenticity, I am not complaining.

I will be back, next time hopefully to dine in.

Thank you for a very tasty dish and value for money! 😋

Iv lived in balwyn north  for over 20 years and i rarely eat in my suburb maibly because i believe if you want a real asian experience you go...to Chinatown   and i am still right .this place  calls itself  malaysian  / Thai unfortunately  its neither.im of italian descent and i can whip up a tastier meal than what they served me last nite
 oh well maybe except for the roti.
Place is spotlessly clean and well laid out 
Only 1 staff member who must have trained in a eastern european restuarant  just put the food down no chit chat no smiles mo hello no goodbye
We ordered satay chicken and  san choi bow both reasonably  tasty  satay sauce was bland and tasteless from a bottle id suggest.
Thai r green chicken curry  and beef rendang i make an awesome beef rendang so was excited to get a  genuine malaysian one. Omg a couple of cut up steak piece still with fat attached no coconut milk  no  dessicated coconut no heat no spice no green beans it wasxedible but as i said before perfect for a nursing home. My buddy wouldnt let me point out these defencies to waitress /chef he gets embarrassed roti was ok though as was coconut rice.
Thai green curry same thing tasteless spiceless and a first with slices of potato
Dunno where they got that idea from
Obviously not from thailand

Most important thing which is the food is average. I tried green thai prawns, lemon grass chicken and some beef and they weren't worth it. Not tasteless but not tasty either. I don't thing the seafood is fresh which...is what I expect for that price. 
Next thing, the service is poor. The women was rather not helpfull. Like she was afraid to do her job and didn't interact with us. This is not what I expect in the restaurant. She also brought us a different dish and said that this is what we ordered. We accepted it because it wasn't a big thing but I didn't like the approach that she told us that it is our fault. 
I don't like the interior and the place itself. 
Last thing, the prices are extremely high for what you get. It is not a popular location, the food is poor/average, stuff is not nice, place is nothing special so I don't know what the price are for.

However, there has been a change of management and the quality of the food has deteriorated. The duck in the Red Duck Curry seems smaller & tougher, the beef in the Pad with cashews is drier & more chewy...but the ultimate insult occurred on our most recent visit, when we ordered our usual calamari. To our disappointment & anger, we discovered that there was a little bit of calamari, but most of the dish was in fact fish in batter. Initially they denied this but finally the waitress fessed up but there was no explanation and no apology. The chef made no appearance to eat humble pie.. At the end of the meal, they had the cheek to charge us the full amount. Eventually we got a discount. If they have done this to us, one wonders how many others have been duped. It is truly amazing that they thought we would not notice.  Needless to say, our semi regular visits will now cease. We will not be dining at the Union Tree again. Totally unacceptable and very disappointing.More",Date of visit: January 2019,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Nat is cheerful, friendly and well organised. The menu is extensive, the servings are generous, the quality is good,(although the beef can sometimes be a little chewy), and the prices...are very reasonable. It is also BYO wine & beer and licensed. If you forget to bring a bottle, you can always buy one in the nearby bottle shop. It is closed on Mondays, and I suggest that you make a booking as it always seems to have plenty of diners. Definitely worth a try.More",Date of visit: August 2018,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The Roti is good as is Khao Soi but many other dishes lack consistency - thus my rating of Lucky Dip. Then again it doesn't claim to be 5 star.   Price...is right with nothing over $20 and you can pretty much get 2 courses for $20.   Its an alternative to KFC or Maccas with a lot more variety.

This review is based on two lunch visits with work colleagues. With a wide...range of dishes to select for individual dining or even a shared experience, prices are very reasonable and the ability to split payment makes it very conducive to work lunch occasions.

For the first visit the Penang curry with roti was my lunch, and for my second visit I tried the pad thai with pork belly.

The only areas which were not as optimal included the fact that there were no fans and the Melbourne weather for our second visit was a very warm day (30-degrees) so even after drawing close the curtain, the atmosphere was bordering on uncomfortable for patrons.

Service was reasonable and the time to serving food was quite fast given ours was a group booking arrangement.More",Date of visit: October 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Ambience: Warm, delightful, tastefully decorated

Service: The waiting staff are nice and friendly and the ladies are pretty with nice smiles. Attentive and thoughtful.

Food: I had been trying their different ways of cooking whole Barramundi...fish. All yummy. 
I always order the roast duck red curry, its ok. I did not like that they put whole cherry tomatoes and whole grapes. I want the normal duck curry without fruits in it. Three times I ordered and they never get it right like the Thai restaurants in the city. I wont be ordering it again. 

Its also good since can do BYO for alcohol. 
Prices: Reasonable

I recommend it for dating, meeting friends, family affairs.More",Date of visit: June 2016,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The quantity and quality of the dishes are very good and the service is also very good. Very clean and modern premises, large enough to cater large groups.

Really no complaints, maybe a touch...pricey, but then, all Thai restaurants are not cheap to eat in. We went with friends and had the banquet which was not cheap, but was enough food, maybe a little too much, which isn't a bad thing.

Total bill was just over $150 for 4 people.

Compared to Epping Thai and Narai Thai (Bundoora), I would make this restaurant better than both of them.

We will go back again, even if it is further to drive.More",Date of visit: May 2016,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

"5/10 Thai - Takeway bar with Restaurant seats, much better around",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g1117320-d3639816-r600911600-Thongsuk_Thai-Bentleigh_Glen_Eira_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",325davej,10 reviews,Reviewed 30 July 2018 ,"We booked for Saturday night 28/07/2018 and visited at 7.30pm at the restaurant for a small celebration, 3 people.

When arriving the takeaway part of the restaurant ( the front entrance ) was busy, and instantly we noticed that we were very overdressed.  We suggest...jeans and tracky pants.  We stood at the door for a good 4 minutes like lost tourists at a train station, with the workers walking past us, then finally a girl said “ Booking ? ” to which we looked around as there was about 8 spare tables anyway and only 3 tables seated.  So she grabbed 3 x rather stained takeaway menu’s and we sat at the rear ( the restaurant section )  We always tend to go by the type of people that are in a restaurant and it was mainly age late 60’s groups.

We brought a bottle of wine as the website says BYO wine.  Which, you would think meant that anything else could be purchased there ? not the case. When we asked for a beer they said that they were totally BYO ? and did not sell alcohol at all, so one of us was without any drink  ( never a good thing for a celebration )  however we shared the wine, all good. Maybe a licencing thing. The option would have been nice to have and I think that the website needs updating to BYO ALL alcohol.

The table was dirty, as were the floors generally, lots of little slippery spots, the décor was fine,  the seats were comfortable.  Generally, the look and feel of the place is nothing like the website. The service overall was slow, we poured our own wine, and the overall priority seemed to be the takeaway meals. Dirty plates were cleared after long periods and there really did not seem to be an effort on the restaurant side of things.

We have to say that the food overall was ok, not great, not amazing definitely and not anything that would return for.  Starters of salt and pepper squid were fresh, but nearly cold ( sitting around for a while ? ) the tofu was good, moneybags were fine, as were the curry puffs.  The mains was also nice, however on two of them,  they used a granulated dried garlic sprinkle similar to that found in the supermarket spice isle from Masterfoods,  instead of fresh. Possibly a cost thing ? who knows.

While the food tasted ok, everything about the place was a 5/10. Unfortunately, two out of three of us became a little ill the next day, enough so, that we were forced to remain close to any ‘Public facilities’ regardless of where we went.
This lasted for 24 hours so we would not return simply for that fact alone just to be safe.  This was the only meal we had immediately prior to this.  Might be a coincidence,  but worth a mention.

Overall, the hygiene was a 5/10 as was the service and the food.  An overall disappointing experience. Cheap, yes $90.00 for 3 people for entrée and mains. However,  I believe that you get what you pay for,  and in some ways to continue paying for the meal in the 24 hours afterwards ( so to speak ) somewhat overshadowed the cost.More",Date of visit: July 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I travel to Bangkok several times a year, mainly for the experience of Thai street food. This Thai food was very dumbed down, presumably to cater to Western tastes? There was no chili at all.

I've experienced this back when I was a teenager; it was and still is etched in my mind as a soup that hits you with its lime's fragrance and light spices, a hint...of chilies that invite your eyes to dive your spoon into that lightly dotted red clear soup.
Lightly, addictive well balanced soup with a hint of spice, sweetness, acidity, Lemongrass, fish sauce and those big Tiger Prawns, hence it will be that signature Thai dish in my mind, albeit the average $9-12/bowl price average in Melbourne.

This restaurant with a big name like Tom Yum is nicely located, great suburb of Melbourne, okay interior, pleasant service but sadly their dishes are lacking in punches and presentation, missing that addictive Thai taste in your palate.

I just hope that they'll do something about it, soon.More",Date of visit: August 2015,3  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The first time we were made to wait long time at the door before being acknowledged. Then we were ignored while waiting to order, the waitress served newer customers first, saw us,...and continued ignoring us for a good 1 5-20 minutes. We left on the spot. It had been a while so we gave it a second chance. After ordering our meal, paying on the spot and being seated at a table, the waitress came to us with an extra charge to eat in. My brother complained and she agreed to let us stay as she knew we were eating in when we paid. Still, the meal was served to us in take away containers with little plates on the side which we had to set out for ourselves. Just very shabby and unwelcoming service, didn’t make us want to return.

The restaurant is a clean and trendy little place on Smith St with friendly service but the pricing here is a bit odd - if you...order a large boiled rice for a party of 4, they then offer unlimited rice afterwards, very generous. They also had Happy Hour where they offered $1 freshly shucked oysters. Yet, on the other hand, we initially ordered the vegan pad thai ($16) but then decided to change it to the prawn pad thai ($25) which only had one king prawn sitting on top of the noodle dish. I think $9 for one prawn is a bit expensive for this place. It's not fine dining.

Food is way overpriced and service could not be any worse. Firstly we booked in a few days in advance for a family of 6, and when we arrived they put us on the bar seating (seriously?) we purchased...a deal of a tapas type meal and ordered some more dishes but ended up waiting over an hour before the first tiny tiny dish came, and had to share that around with everyone because we were hungry. Later in the evening a table outside freed up so we moved over there, carrying our own plates cutlery and glasses, no help from the staff. Then waited for almost another hour before all the dishes but one came. We checked and they just simply said they didn’t write it down. For the whole time we were sitting outside, not one staff came and check up on us, when we wanted something we always had to go to the bar to ask for it. They didn’t even clear the table so we ended up piling all the plates we finished on the ground under the table. The food was okay but certainly way overpriced and didn’t compensate for all the wait and horrible service. So needless to say we felt ripped off and will never dine there again.More",Date of visit: January 2018,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Food was delicious, full of spices and flavour with good cuts of meat. Unfortunately the Miang Betel Leaf was unavailable but the Goong Ma Kam (Tiger...Prawns) were delicious as was the hot and spicy Larb Ped. The mains shared were the chicken Pad Thai, Crispy Pork Belly (yum!!!) and Massaman Beef. The only slight feedback was that although the Massaman beef was tender and full of flavour the vegetables (carrot and potato) were a little under done. Overall the meal was exactly what we were looking for and although not cheap, the cuts of meat were very high quality.

My only criticism is that the price point for wine is too expensive with a limited selection by the glass and bottles available for around $70. It would be nice to have a broader range available (esp. as quite an extensive cocktail menu is available) to better match the food cost.

We were there for nearly 2 hours for the Living Social deal of 3 courses. There were 2 wait staff for the entire restaurant, which, seeing as most were visiting on this...voucher and had pre-booked, they should have known was not going to be enough. 
People actually walked out because they had been waiting too long for service and food. 
We ordered extra oysters, had to request them 3 times and they took 45 minutes to appear. Same with the drinks - I ordered an extra beer which was forgotten about, half an hour later after being reminded it was poured. We ordered coconut rice, yet sticky rice was delivered to our table (it was delivered almost 15 mins after the mains, which we had nearly finished by then, so we couldn't be bothered sending the rice back as we would have been there til midnight waiting for the right food to be delivered at the right time).
Lastly, because everything took so long and our parking was about to run out, we requested the dessert to take away. The lady apparently didn't hear this, and said she would give me the extra beer for free. I assumed this was because i had to ask 3 times for it and it took 30 mins to pour one beer. 

However it turns out she thought i said i didn't want the dessert, so was giving me the free beer in place of that. I eventually got dessert to take away as was determined to at least get what we paid for, it was the smallest takeaway container with a couple of pieces of banana in and some ice cream. 

On the whole, disastrous. Which is a shame as the food (when it eventually arrived) was delicious. Authentic Thai, unusual combinations and perfectly cooked beef cheek, also crab curry was yummy.
 
Fantastic chefs let down by the customer-facing staff. 
Not listening to customers, slow service, completely forgetting orders, not knowing how to work the computerised order system and till. If they had got their acts together or at least apologised and given a reason for the complete shambles last Wednesday (1st November) they would have gained a lot of brand new customers as the food was yummy. But now we will not return.

On the plus side we arrived in time for the Happy Hour, that was $1 freshly shucked Oysters. In my opinion this is where we should have stopped....We ordered a curry ""GAENG POO"" and the ""KA NA MOO GROB"" with a couple of Mugs of draft Singha. 

Oysters, great .. came with a wonderful Chili and Lime Sorbet and dried shallots, I am a fan of Oysters and these were fresh and the dressing lively and with a hint of Chili.

GAENG POO - A curry with crabmeat ... well as I find consistently in Melbourne the Thai food is cooked with way too much sugar, resulting in an unbalanced taste on the sweet side. Both my Thai partner and I agreed that this was too sweet, and less sugar would have resulted in a much better result.

KA NA MOO GROB - This was a tasty dish, with the Crispy pork Belly, sliced thinly with a decent crunch. The Broccoli was firm and well cooked. A bit more Chili would have benefited the dish, but I understand that these dishes are typically cooked for Western taste-buds.
Overall the food was ok, but for Oysters, two dishes, rice and two beers coming to $84, I feel it is well priced outside what I would expect for Thai food.More",Date of visit: October 2017,3  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Food is quite tasty, and service is amiable and friendly.  However they didn't take note of our special requests...and one dish we specifically asked for to be ""mild"" arrived absolutely laden with very hot chillies so it was inedible to the person who ordered it.  The wine we had was not great - however in fairness, could just have been a bad choice on our part. The chairs are high wooden bar stools (with no backs to hang jackets on) - and the restaurant offers absolutely nowhere else to sit your jackets so if you don't want to keep your jacket on for the meal, it ends up having to be on floor.More",Date of visit: August 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The service was friendly and attentive.  Our entrees came quickly. Then we had a steady flow of amazing...Thai dishes.  The calamari and pla pla (kingfish) were absolutely outstanding.  The other dishes were ""normal"" Thai - cooked perfectly.  

The bar area would be great for a date.  The restaurant feels a little like an upmarket night club with the atmosphere of a classic French wine cellar.  So having great Thai food over drinks would be a fantastic way to start the night.

We ordered the 3 signature cocktails, 2 entrees and 2 mains.

The food was great but simply too sweet for our tastes having spent many years travelling to Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.

We started with Son in law Eggs...and the Papaya Salad, which had a lovely spicy flavour, however the tamarind sauce and SOMTUM dressing were both far too sweet.

The first cocktail arrived after the eggs, piled high with crushed ice.

Our first main course arrived along with another cocktail, crammed with crushed ice.

Just as our final main course arrived so did our 3rd cocktail, mine. It was so full of crushed ice that I had trouble getting the straw to the bottom of the glass, then in 2 sips it was gone.... not great value at $20 although what I tasted was very nice.

The 10 hr braised beef in green curry was very tender although the beef tasted as though it was added to the green curry not cooked in it, the green curry was again, too sweet.

All in all, good food just too much sugar and good tasting cocktails made with very expensive ice!More",Date of visit: April 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

@cookatoo_kitchen is a simple place to eat in (or try the takeaway which was doing a  roaring trade while we were there).

Authentic. 
Simple. 
Whole food.
Plus a friendly chef and helpful staff. 
Plenty of choices on the menu for everyone, without being trivial and cliched. 
We started with #korokke which is like a croquette with 3 in a serve. They are a beautiful blend of  crumbed mashed potato, corn, pea, carrot, onion, green bean all served with sweet soy sauce. 
For main courses: Udon Pad Satay with a side serve of #rotibread
Poke Bowl with vegan chicken katsu. 
Japanese Curry Don with jasmine rice and roti.
@cookatoo_kitchen  is located at the Punt Road end of #bridgeroadrichmond
This is a must not just for vegetarians and vegans but for anyone who enjoys the taste of Thailand.

1) we waited on our table waiting to be served but eventually had to ask for menu
2) service was like an uneducated person with no basic human manner first day of work or like an owner of the restaurant who earns money anyway without customers
3) we couldn't help but notice the obvious girls staff gossiping about other customer

This brings a turndown to people who actually enjoys the food here. 

It is such a shame how much more successful this restaurant can be if only the waitress are properly sorted and trained.

Our most recent meal, however, was anything but enjoyable. Our entree selection of mixed entree for two, and drinks were delivered promptly to our...table and we were pleased with the quality of the food. When our mains came out, initially the wrong meal was delivered, beef instead of the seafood that we had ordered. While we waited for that dish to be cooked, we had Pad Thai with chicken & a chicken Yellow curry. The curry was quite bland & the chicken pieces were very large, fatty & tough. The Pad Thai was lacking in vegetables & the chicken was again in huge pieces & extremely tough & dry. Neither dish was enjoyable. Our order of Satay Seafod came out & looked fantastic. However although the prawns were well cooked, the calamari was so tough that it was inedible. We decided to dine here, in part, due to the reviews and recommendations plastered over the window. It has a quirky atmosphere, but the food component of a restaurant is the main reason that one chooses to visit. Unlike other reviews of this establishment on Trip Advisor, our recommendation would be to give this one a miss. On paying the account & asked if we enjoyed our meal, my husband was diplomatically honest about our food. "" I'm sorry"", was the only response & there was no consideration given to adjusting our account based on our dining experience. We have enjoyed many wonderful Thai meals, but this certainly was not one.More",Date of visit: February 2015,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The two waitress' on duty didn't bother to clear the table of empty dishes, even when trying to find room for the next course.  In fact they seemed less interested in attending to tables than they did walking around with their heads down.

To top it off one waitress knocked over a glass of (expensive) champagne and made only a half hearted attempt to clean the mess.  A subtle suggestion that compensation for the $20 glass of champagne would be appropriate was met with a blank stare!

My first time here was years and years ago, and somehow just had my sights set on revisiting last night.  I don't think the decor or anything has changed since that first visit, as it was stuck...somewhere between the 70s-90s.

With that said, the service was reasonably good.  There were only a few people in the restaurant at the time we got there, yet somehow, all tables got their meals out of order.  The people ordering their meals just a half minute before us, got their entree 15 minutes before ours came out, but we got our mains before them.

The food was quite good.  I had the curry puffs and the chicken fried rice and all of mine was tasty.  My friends both said their sauces were quite salty, and apparently the cashews were soft and mushy.  The other hiccup was nicely resolved though - whereby two soft drinks were definitely out of date, so the lady offered to take them back and gave them a bottle of sparkling water at no charge.

It's a very nice casual meal here.  I think with so many other choices in Melbourne, there's no need to rush back again, but if anyone in the area asked me where I'd suggest they eat, I'd definitely recommend it.More",Date of visit: May 2022,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It obviously caters to the student crowd, plus dinner guests, and since the table numbers are limited given the shop's small space, seats can run out quickly during busy times.

Once you sort out your order with...the Grump (you'll know what I mean if you happen to visit when she's there) - this requires looking at the wall chart, the somewhat intimidating sheet at the cashier AND maybe browsing through their photo menu, you'll be treated to delicious and (I think) authentic flavours.

My personal favourites include the pork shank and any noodle dish with the ""fish noodles"" which are essentially fishball meal made into noodle shape. Yum!

PS ""Yen to fu"" is the Thai take on yong tau hu, a noodle dish commonly found in Singapore and Malaysia.More",Date of visit: February 2017,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had the red curry and my bro had the beef stir fry both were superb well presented and the flavours truly Thai.

Read the reviews and thought to have a good meal but were quite disappointed. It was Tuesday night, the restaurant was empty and very quiet, which...helped us to have some privacy but still our service was quite slow. I wonder what it would be like if they were busy. Tasted some entreeis, pork stir fry, green curry and fried rice with seafood. The portions are generous and prices are within $20 range but that was probably the only positive. Only stir fry was nice, not hot enough for my liking but good. There are many Thai restaurants in Melbourne with much better offering.More",Date of visit: December 2019,2  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We came here after a visit to QVM down the road and were the only patrons here until a bit later. It’s a cute little restaurant and the...atmosphere is very relaxed. You go up to the counter to order and help yourselves to water and I think cutlery too (my friend did the serving).

We ordered the Jewels of the Sea, Malaysian char kway teow, wonton soup, sweet and sour vegetables with soy nuggets, salt and pepper tofu, tempeh and 2 bowls of rice for the 4 of us. My favourite was the Jewels of the Sea, sweet and sour vegetables with soy nuggets and salt and pepper tofu. The char kway teow was a bit bland and none of us were really fans of the tempeh (we ordered it cos one of us had never tried it before).

It’s been a while since I’ve dined at the Brisbane branch, so I can’t compare. But, this Melbourne is definitely worth a visit should you have friends who are vegans/vegetarians or you’re just after a meat-free meal.More",Date of visit: July 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We ordered starters to share, then mains to share, so we had that great thing going on where you just get to keep diving in and trying new things.

I'm...gluten-free vegetarian and was very well taken care of. We balanced this with another guest who is vegetarian-eats-seafood and a guest who particularly enjoys meat and spice. Fun times!

The flavours were excellent, portion sizes generous and everything was delivered in good time. Prices are reasonable. Wine list is succinct and not very specific - this place is more about the food than the wine. 

Our server was particularly delightful, she made us feel so welcome.

Inside the restaurant is very comfortably set out and it's good for smaller or larger groups (we sat alongside a few couples and a gentleman dining alone) - it's a great atmosphere.

The only thing I would call out is that the lighting was a bit bright - it would be great if the restaurant could be dimmed.

Highly recommended if you love Thai food, are looking for a place to catch up with friends or are in the neighbourhood.

It is decorated in a restrained manner with tall wide windows facing the street.

I have purchased take-away food several times from here.

My wife loved the Tom Kha soup.
The kids enjoyed the Satay Chicken....I have had the Gaeng Massamun Neur (curry) several times. The meat breaks apart easily and has a wonderful flavour. There is plenty of potato, onions and peanuts.

The first time I came here was shortly after they opened. Thankfully the front of house issues have been solved by relegating the men back to the kitchen whilst the ladies take care of the customers.

The food is authentic, well prepared and has good flavour.
The take-away containers are thoughtfully sealed by cling wrap.More",Date of visit: June 2016,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

This one in the Galleria on the corner of Bourke and Elizabeth Streets is a busy one due to its location which also makes it a little...noisy. 
At 1pm, it’s buzzing with people on their lunch break. And plenty of choices of other eateries in true ‘food court’ style area, there is certainly a wide selection of global food to choose from.
Today, I ordered the massaman  curry plus roti. My small ‘cardboard bowl’ and the rice were served on a tray and I could choose from disposable napkin, chopsticks and spoon. Fortunately I’d brought that with me. Taste was good and served nice and hot. Not too spicy for me. A total of 6 pieces of tender beef in the bowl, two pieces of carrot and potato plus plenty of sauce that soaks nicely with the rice and roti. 
It amazes me how the revolving menu on the tv screens entice you but what is served looks very different. Not that the food wasn’t good but it’s just that you buy with your eye and my lunch didn’t look anything like the promotion. (See photo).
The meal isn’t cheap - $27 ish dollars for the meal plus an iced tea. 
Staff were good and service was fast. But at this price, it’s time to explore something in Chinatown.

Vego curry puff - Lukewarm (from Bain Marie). Lacking flavour and pretty average!

Vego pad thai - Slightly sweet but spice level good. Not enough tofu but ok array of veg, nice egg and...al dente noodles.

Pork belly pad thai - Ever so slightly too sweet, although chilli and fresh lemon cut it back a bit. Pork was a bit variable - some bits bordering on dry, while others had fat that had not rendered or crisped at all (not a huge amount either, so not really worth the $ IMO).

Tofu and veg green curry - Tofu (not heaps), cabbage (odd), carrot (too big), broccoli was WAY too big and a bit coarse, green capsicum (which was quite big, but ok). Although the curry sauce was a little thin, it was quite spicy (which I liked)!

As a big #hokiennoodle fan, I headed to #qvmelbourne to try @thailander_aus off #lonsdalestreetmelbourne for a lunch time tasty treat.

I’m always reluctant to order food on...a computer screen at a restaurant but heck, gave it a go. And it was easy peasy. 

You can choose your protein, your extras such as roti as well as drinks.

I ordered a #currylaksa  along with a small serve of roti and a freebie iced tea because I scanned the code at the front of the restaurant. 

Service is a little slow - because so many people were ordering. Fine with me. Tells me that it’s a good place to eat. So within 15 minutes I had my lunch and made my way to one of the many tables to dine peacefully. 

Taste was pretty good and portion size excellent. Would like in future to bring my own bowl and cutlery as there is so much disposable wastage.

Notes: wheelchair accessible, plenty of other choices of restaurants nearby, friendly staff and nice atmosphere.

Look forward to exploring more of the menu in the future.

Bland - I love Thai but not Thailander,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d14980121-r831493971-Thailander-Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",Tina A,1 review,Reviewed 18 March 2022 ,"I love Thai food especially stir fry with ginger, basil, chilli and chicken. This should be full of flavour and delicious.

SADLY Thailander does not live up to the expectation. Except for the sauce being too salty and unless you get some basil, the food...is bland, bland, bland. The chicken has no flavour and there are not enough vegetables (unless you like chunky onion). For the price you pay, it's not worth it, because you end up throwing it away after a few bites. I've tried it a couple of times now, hoping it might improve, but it hasn't and I won't got there again. 
Sorry Thailander, but a big thumbs down from me.More",Date of visit: March 2022,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The mains; 
-Red curry prawns (5 prawns) with scant veg, 
-Green curry chicken -way over cooked / more than...likely reheated veg (green and red capsicum that’s it) in a very bland fatty coconut cream sauce. The chicken although fillet chicken there honestly would not have been any more than a whole chicken tenderloin sliced up. Very very poor!
-main of king garlic prawns; there is no way on earth those prawn were ‘king’ size; they were in fact frozen prawns, way, way over cooked, shrivelled up and tasted terribly muddy and messy old. I don’t think I have ever had worse prawns; same prawns in the red curry prawns. 
Not to mention the fact that the garlic prawns were served in a sauce you could only describe as oil with garlic plus extra oil -think oil sauce was just disgusting.
-the roti -again clearly not house / home made and not even toasted enough (still raw pastry patches)
-the rice however was the highlight of the order -we purchased 2 large steamed rice -both containers only ¾ full -not sure why a food establishment would be so tight as to only fill the containers for rice only m ¾ full beats me.

$80 down. 30min wait (and we ordered at 6pm -no one even dining in yet)
Not looking forward to polishing the porcelain tomorrow morning; I’m certain it’s going to be an epic event.More",Date of visit: September 2018,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I couldn't have been more clear about my allergy to garlic and onion (fructose), stipulating no fresh, powders, nothing. This time I even mentioned if they put any sauce into their food (having run into this problem before), please...check it! I saw the girl write it on the docket. No onion, no garlic. Returning to my hotel, I began to pick through and noticed first the chives, then the chunks of onion. Really?? I walked back, expected staff who were fully apologetic (yes, mistakes can happen). The chef comes out, not at all concerned. I showed him the onions I'd pulled out of my dinner. First he said the green ones weren't onions, they were chives. Obviously very knowledgeable about food.... then that the brown onions were in the pre-mix that they use for their pad thai; they don't cook it fresh. I said I was very specific about my intolerance when ordering. He took zero responsibility for his mistake, and certainly couldn't care less about the pain it could have put me in. Asking if I wanted something else, I said at this point I did not. He literally waved his hand in my face and walked back to the kitchen. Wow. No excuse for this. And if I had a peanut allergy or something else that could land me in the hospital??? There is too much choice these days for people like this to be cooking food for us.... for us patrons who are able to choose where we eat. I won't go into my refund process which was also horrendous. I walked down the street to Royal Siam. No onions, no garlic in my food and actually had fresh carrot and coriander...at Strictly Thai there was nothing but bean sprouts. And, of course...onion. If I could rate Strictly Thai in the negative, I certainly would.More",Date of visit: May 2017,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

These guys nailed it! Fresh ingredients, delicious plates and that friendly Thai service with a smile...(without the constant 'in your face ""are you ready to order now"" typical waiter' service). The cleanliness of the restaurant was definitely an attractor, but everything else from there just added to our experience. With 2 children under 10, it's hard to find a place where you can relax, but the service and attention that these guys displayed was perfect. We will absolutely be regular visitors here.. It would be great to see some additions to the entree menu like pork or seafood spring rolls other than just vege, and the oysters definitely need to stay! The menu over all is more than adequate, which often make it hard to decide on a dish, but I guess that's a good thing. Dishes are well priced, as are the beverages - and they've got a pretty good selection. Best part of the night for me was the Chilli Basil Prawns with Veg. My wife lived the Pad Thai (claiming it was one of the best she's had) and the kids needed a further order of Tempura Prawns and Chicken Satay to satisfy. Overall - Awesome! Will surely replace our Fish&Chip Fridays with Strictly Thai! Just one suggestion however - please re-calibrate the light sensor in the toilet, me & my 6yo found it a bit difficult to see after the lights went out within about half a minute 😀More",Date of visit: March 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Firstly the food; we ordered the Pad Thai Chicken, Chicken Green Curry, Deep Fried Prawns, Yum Pet (Duck) and Fried Rice to be home delivered. The Duck and Green...Curry were acceptable with nice flavours and a good amount of spice. However the Pad Thai and the Fried Rice were tasteless and had no flavour whatsoever and the Deep Fried Prawns were far too salty and oily. Very unappetizing.
We called the restaurant explaining the situation and asking for a simple refund on the items which were not acceptable. Initially we were not offered any recompense, but came to an agreement to be refunded for the Green Curry and Duck.
Once we had driven out to the restaurant to pick up our cash refund, we were confronted by the delivery boy who stated that we would no longer be receiving the refund for both items, totally contrary to the agreement made with the employee over the phone. He claimed that it was our fault for ordering the wrong items (as if to imply there are certain items on the menu which should be avoided?) and that he was the one who would decide what the refund should be.
After a heated argument, one of the chefs eventually came out, realizing the error in them pulling out of the agreement and gave us the refund for the two items.
Unacceptable quality of service and food, given that over $100 was spent; very disappointed.More",Date of visit: April 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The red light setting is romantic & inviting with train style booths in the middle of the restaurant.  I'd imagine you'd need to book in a group for this.

The rest of the dishes we ordered were so full of flavour and ample serving size.  The lemongrass beef was so flavoursome and the...beef so tender.  The Panang lamb curry was equally as good and the Chu Chee prawns what a fabulous dish.  Extensive menu to cover all food categories.
I was told by the Manager that evening that everything is made fresh in house starting from the satay  peanut sauce and the spring rolls are individually hand made on order.  He also said the owners pride themselves on sourcing the freshest ingredients and all their food is MSG free.
I noticed that they cater well for vegetarian and vegan patrons. 
The outstanding point is that one of our group is coeliac and after speaking directly with the chef about her dietary needs she was very happy with the food she was served.

Everything was lacklustre and would be disappointing if it arrived as a takeaway meal. Green beans were old and the vegetables were obviously the same mass produced crap that you see with take away meals. Thai places are usually a safe bet as the chefs tend to take pride in what they do. This was bland and disgusting. Lazy chefs that couldn't care less firing out rubbish for paying customers.

Last night I had a green Thai curry with coconut milk, vegies and tofu accompanied by rice.  The...flavours were wonderful, aromatic and clean - note that the spice is very generous (hot stuff!), so be sure to tell them if you prefer it mild, this won't be a problem.

Prices are reasonable and portion sizes plentiful.

Note that the service isn't so great.  The staff are so incredibly lovely, it's impossible to get grumpy, they just don't seem too experienced with restaurant work that's all.  On saying that, this has improved each time I've visited, so perhaps just a teething problem.

It's in a good location with plenty of street parking and while there's not a lot of curb appeal, it sounded good, so thought we'd give...it a go.

The interior is a little odd; quite a mish mosh of decor.  But it smelled good inside, so we were eager to see what the food was like.

They took our order promptly, and were accommodating with requests.  The food came out in good time, which was more impressive since they were doing a few take out orders.  The entrees were nice.  Generic chicken spring rolls and chicken curry puffs.  They were really nice and would probably order again.  For my main, I had the chicken fried rice and though it was really nothing to look at (presentation left much to be desired) the food was very good.  The kitchen honoured our requests for changes to the dishes, and the mains also came out in reasonable timing.  

From a pricing point of view, I think it was very reasonable.  Mains were in the mid teens, and on a par with other small Thai restaurants.  

Overall ... would I come back again?  If I was in the area, I'd definitely come back again.  There wasn't anything really bad about it here at all.  Considering it's almost a 30 minute drive from home to it, I'd be more inclined to try elsewhere first.  But if you find yourself in Sandringham and want a good Thai meal, give this a try for sure.More",Date of visit: December 2020,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tom Yum soup, and Pad Thai were perfect, although the soup needed some bird's-eye chillies floating in the mix. The weak link was the Larb Gai (chicken salad) which was pretty much flavourless...and bland. It desperately needed some fish sauce and some lime juice - there was a jar on the table of chilli paste and some of that helped, and I asked for some fish sauce (I was given about a table spoon in a tiny tub), and that made a big difference - but it was also missing ginger and garlic as well. Presentation needed sliced cucumber and more lettuce, although mint and basil leaves were present. In Thailand I love this dish, so this restaurant version was a big disappointment. The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices are very reasonable. The place was full with I assume locals, and I am sure it fulfils a need for diversity in the area - a popular place on the bay. I would try it again.More",Date of visit: October 2018,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The food, while cooked fast, was small in portion sizes -...the Roti is possibly the smallest you will find in the world, and the coconut rice doesn't taste like coconut at all!  The Pad Thai (beef) tasted as if it was contaminated by 'fish' and was very oily in texture.  A quick phone call to the restaurant ensured a replacement dish was cooked for us however we had to drive back to the restaurant to pick it up - there was no offer of them delivering it he to us despite this being a service they offered their customers.

In general the food was a very high standard and reasonably priced as well.  One negative is its fully licensed, so no...BYO anything. But their drink prices weren't over priced, so its no big deal.  But don't expect an extensive wine list, because its pretty basic. 

The table service wasn't the best experience I've had, with the waitress rather rudely asking us to hurry up and order.  After we placed our orders we found the waiting time for our first course to be excessive.  You'd like to think that this wasn't pay back for the waitress waiting for our order.  However there seemed to be more urgency placed on the phone orders and pickups by on foot customers than that of the eat in customers like us which probably explained our long wait.  But when the food arrived, it was really good, so all was forgotten. 

So if you're not in a hurry and want to have a relaxing meal, then by all means eat here as the food it very good indeed and good value as well.More",Date of visit: October 2013,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

We were not disappointed.  This relatively new restaurant provided excellent, authentic dishes  (never had better Beef Rendang in Melbourne) at very affordable prices.  Small restaurant with modern décor and friendly service.  We re-ordered several dishes and...all were served promptly.  The staff were chatty and good fun but not intrusive.  The only ""criticism"" was that the second round of plain rice we ordered was coconut rice, no to everyone's liking.  I suspect it may have been late and all they had left for Nasi Lemak orders.

Absolutely poor excuse for a Thai restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g3331148-d11680629-r864593309-Thaiger_Rabbit-Abbotsford_Yarra_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,Brian E,121 reviews,Reviewed 15 October 2022 ,"Ordered a red curry with crispy pork. The curry was mediocre in taste; that was tolerable. My main gripe is that for a $23 dish there was exactly 4 pieces of crispy pork, which was 90% fat and 10% pork, in the whole curry. Amounted...to probably 50gm of meat or one desert spoonful- I am not kidding. The rest of the curry was made of roughly chopped vegetables which were undercooked and loads of sauce. I realise this is meant to be “authentic” but have had better looking, tasting and quality dishes than this in little restaurants here and in Thailand. When I complained, the waiter was rude and defensive. My review is not the only one which contains complaints about portions, taste and service. As for the rave reviewers, are you sure you were at this place?!More",Date of visit: October 2022,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The restaurant is nicely...decorated and had a good vibe. Alas, the service was substandard. One person looking after everything. Poor woman was rushed off her feet and although trying her best she was clearly not coping. Menu is extensive and the food is food but really I’ve had better. So the ambience was what kept this review at a 3 instead of a 2. 
Not really wheelchair friendly. Quite a small restaurant. Parking is always a challenge in Smith Street but be patient.

I ordered a dish of rice noodles with chicken & vegetables.
The overall dish was totally tasteless (I would have thought this was impossible with Thai food), & there were NO condiments on the table to beef things up.
There were exactly THREE pieces of chicken.

It was not busy, and we took the opportunity to converse with the staff. They actually wrote down our names, and our preferences, for future orders they will know how to customise our orders! Imagine that!

The food was...excellent. I had the jungle curry - for some reason any curry with no coconut milk is difficult to find, but this restaurant had two types of coconut milk free curry! It was grand - spicy, light, filling, just about perfect. 

My partner had a whole steamed fish, done just as she likes it.

Prices are quite reasonable (almost too good). Service is a little slow, but because it was extremely friendly we did not care.

Definitely worth visiting. And get to know the staff.More",Date of visit: March 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You deliver your bowl to the counter for weighing,...and choose a cooking style for your ingredients- stir fry, soup and noodle braise. Lots of flavour and heat options. 

My partner chose hot lemongrass (Tom yum?), I had Sichuan and the kids had mild tonkatsu. Delivered quickly, and everything was delicious. Service was warm and efficient. The manager even spent time teaching the kids chopstick technique. Drinks include Asian beers and soft drinks.

Located in the heart of CBD, it makes a wonderful choice for dine in, especially with a big group. 
They introduced us to a set of new menus from new...chef as well.

The staff has prepared the new menu for us for our visit this time. 
We only chose our drinks and menu - a “Feed Us” session this time :) 
Something sweet needed this time so we ordered their classic Cha Nom Yen (Thai milk tea) and Thai Pink Milk. 
The Pink Milk has rosy hint in the taste and overall not too sweet we like it :)

So here’s our dinner menu:

Look shin ping (Grilled pork and fish meatballs - 2 skewers) - $5.
    Simple appetizer grilled to have grilled fragrant dipped with sweet chilli sauce.
    So tender and chewy. Each skewer has three meatballs.

Yum ped yam nam tok (Grilled duck salad) - $18.50.
    Roasted duck salad with Siam dressing topped with sesame oil.
    A hint of zesty from the lime and mild chili. Simple and yet refreshing with the coriander and lettuce.

Tom zap leng (Hot and spicy Thai style pork bones and ribs soup) - $16.50.
    This one is the big soup with the pork bones and ribs inside.
    Love all the herbs and the richness of the broth of this soup.
    A hint of tanginess from the pickled veggies and herbs. Super fragrant as the soup was served. Love it to enjoy this with simple white rice in this cold weather.

Goong ob woon sen (Ginger prawn with glass noodles) - King prawns, fresh garlic, pepper, celery and glass noodles - $24.80.
    This is a very rare Thai food which we will find in Thai restaurants. The dish contains king prawns which are cooked perfectly, the meats were so sweet and tender with a hint of garlic and ginger.
    Love the glass noodles too which served plain only with herbs but complements the prawns nicely. This is our first time to try this dish.

Pad kra tiem prik thai beef (garlic & beef stir fry with dark soy) - $18.80
    Simple stir fry Thai style with garlic based. The beef was super tender and sliced a bit thin so that it is easy to chew. Perfect to eat with rice too. Love to put the sauce on top of the rice. Yummoo!

And for dessert, we ordered crispy banana roll served with vanilla ice cream -$ 9.50.
The banana was so smooth almost like puree inside the crispy rolls drizzled with caramel sauce. So warm and sweet and just perfect to be paired with vanilla ice cream. Super humble looking banana crispy rolls but we seriously love them.

Love how attentive and quick the service was. As usual, do not forget to check the spiciness level with the wait staff just in case you have low spiciness tolerance. @Siam Thai everything is set to be mild, so you do not need to worry. We love everything in the new menu and look forward to come and try their food again.

Note: We’d like to say thank you to @Siam Thai’s team for having us.

This Thai restaurant brings variety of signature dishes from four corners of Thailand (Central, Northern, Northeast, Southern).
Each region has its own uniqueness, but it shares common elements of spicy,...sour, sweet and salty.
We’re delighted to be invited by Siam Thai to have dine in experience.

When we arrived, we’re warmly greeted by the friendly customer staff.
It was a humbly looking restaurant, clean and bright.
The place is pretty spacious, it can cater the small or big group.
The customer service was nice, polite and attentive.
The vibe and atmosphere were cosy and comfortable.

As soon as we’re seated, we’re advised that they’ve already pre-ordered the dishes
for us, it was more like full course menu with entree, main and dessert.
We’re more than happy to be served based on recommended chef selection dishes and here is the following dishes:

Drinks
– Nam Lam Yai (Longan Juice)
The longan juice was freshly served and it wasn’t too sweet. We just simply loved it!
– Cha Ma Nao (Thai Iced Lemon Tea)

Entree
– Chicken Popcorn Isaan
The chicken popcorn was perfectly deep fried and it wasn’t oily or greasy.
It was served warm, crunchy and crispy from outside; from the inside, it was soft and tender.
The chicken was well seasoned and had balance taste.
It was a simple dish but perfectly executed by Siam Thai team, good job!

– Bangkok Papaya Salad
The papaya salad was nicely presented and very appealing.
On top of the dish, there is a decorative chilli; I know it’s bit scary if you are not a spice tolerance person.
No worries, the taste was just mild, it’s more like sweet, sour and little bit spicy.
The overall taste was fresh, balance and perfectly seasoned.
All ingredients were freshly served (tomato, green beans, bean sprouts and others).
It had an aromatic and rich flavour.

Main
– BBQ Pork Neck with Thai Salad
The meats were perfectly grilled (nice col and well seasoned.
Great quality of bbq pork neck, the pork was very tender, juicy and soft.
If you want to have a nice touch of sweet sour and spicy, you can use the sweet thai chilli dipping on the side.
Honestly, the taste of the grilled pork was a fantastic by itself;
It’s definitely a recommended dish to order if you’re visiting this restaurant.

– Khao Soi (Northern Thai Noodles) with Chicken
The noodles was perfectly cooked; it was still tender and chewy when it’s served.
The chicken inside was cooked well and enough seasoned;
It had light taste to balance out the strong taste of the soup.
The texture of the soup was slightly thick.
Tips: If you’re social media lover, worry not about taking too many photos on this dish because you need to eat this one while it’s warm.
If you love a sweet dish, you should go for a Northern part of Thailand; Khao Soi is one of them and surely a perfect dish for you.

– Soft Shell Crab Curry served with Crispy Roti
The dish was generously served with pretty large soft shell crabs.
It was also come with the crispy roti on the side, typical Southern part of Thai dish.
The roti was perfectly fried and had a balance taste.
The soft shell crab was perfectly deep fried and it was served crispy and crunchy from outside, from the inside was tender and juicy.
The texture of the curry wasn’t too thick, still creamy and had a rich taste.
Everything was executed really well on this dish and put so much thought on this dish.
It’s a MUST to order when you are visiting Siam Thai, Bourke Street **The highlight!**

Dessert
Homemade Ice Cream Mango and Coconut.
The ice cream served in the cute glass perfectly fit a scoup of home made ice cream.
The taste was fantastic; It was creamy and the taste was rich.
The texture was smooth and soft.

Overall, we had a great time having dinner in Siam Thai and will add this restaurant in one of our  favourite list Thai place to go.

Note: We’d like to say thank you to Siam Thai team for the invite.

My girlfriend and I ordered satay chicken, I must say it was very very delicious.

The deliciousness of the Satay Chicken couldn't help them though. The wait for the mains was 45 mins.
I got Chicken Pad See Ew and my girlfriend ordered the special soft shell crab Pad Thai. After the wait I was hoping the food would be good. My Pad see ew was great but I must say the soft shell crab pad Thai was a let down. Crab was crispy and was very very salty.

Prices are very reasonable, the premises themselves were quite small and appeared clean, and the staff were friendly.
I was very happy with my Chilli & Basil pork on rice - it was done the right way, minced pork with an...egg on top, just like I'd expect on the streets of Thailand.
We got a grilled pork skewers with sticky rice starter and the pork was pretty dry, chewy and hard. I had the thought that perhaps it's been microwaved, but who knows. It was a struggle pulling the meat off the wooden skewer, though the dish itself was tasty enough.
My only real criticism is that there were no condiments at the tables. I found that my food wasn't as spicy as I tend to like it, so to be truly genuine Thai, I would have liked to see the usual 4 condiments at each table for diners to be able to adjust the Spice, Saltiness, Sweetness and Sourness to their taste.
Being on Smith Street, people watching through the window was certainly amusing. At one point a junkie entered the restaurant and started behaving strangely, crouching down as if hiding from an imaginary goblin, then he laughed and left the premises. I felt a bit uncomfortable and was surprised the staff didn't immediately give him a boot in the backside and throw him out - I certainly would have, especially considering he was doing all this quite close to the cash register!
Anyway, all in all a nice little Thai cafe that serves food like you'd actually find in Thailand, not the usual dulled down stuff that the ""local Thai restaurant"" in the 'burbs tends to serve. I'll certainly pop in again if I'm in the area.More",Date of visit: March 2021,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Stating this means the dim sims could have poisoned someone, they were obviously cooked from frozen and not checked in the middle to see if they were at a proper temperature. When questioned on what they had served we found the Bain-Marie wasn’t even hot and no steam coming off any of the other food either.

They have the menu for vegetarian as well.
Location wise is perfect; easily accessible by public transport for...those who rely on it and plenty spaces of street parking if you drive your own vehicle.

The restaurant is pretty fancy looking Thai restaurant. It's more like casual fine dine restaurant.
The interior design is stylish, authentic and classic modern; each table covered by white tablecloths.
The atmosphere and vibe in this restaurant was really good and the customer service was good.
It wasn't too busy when we came on the weekend.

Anyway, we ordered:
- Chicken with Pandan leaves for $7.50.
  For the entree, we ordered 3 portions of the chicken pandan leaves.
  The chicken was well cooked. It was soft, tender and well seasoned.
  Unfortunately, we found that the chicken with pandan leaves was slightly too oily.

- Pad Thai chicken for $13.40.
  The Pad Thai was too watery and the noodle was little bit soggy. 
  Most of Thai restaurants would be able to nail the Pad Thai as the signature dish, unfortunately this doesn't apply to this restaurant.
  It was definitely not the best Pad Thai we've ever tried, and overall the taste was average.
  
- Tom Yum Soup Prawn $8.90.
  Really? The portion was so tiny and only 70% Tom Yum Soup and approximately 2 shrimps and around 15-25 thin slices of mushrooms.
  We even asked to the wait staff politely to double check that we ordered the large Tom Yum soup to share, she confirmed that this one was the large size.
  We would definitely understand if they charged us this value for more generous portion.
  Hmmmm.... anyway, the taste of the tom yum soup was really good and had balance flavour (sweet / sour).
  Nothing's wrong with the taste as we loved it, but it wasn't worth to order due to the portion and the price, I reckoned it's a portion for 1 person.
  
- Yellow Curry Vegie for $12.90.
  Surprisingly, the vegetarian curry turned out to be pretty good compared to others.
  The taste of curry was creamy, rich, balance and flavourful.
  The vegetables were well cooked, it wasn't overcooked.
  Happy to recommend this one.
  
- Sweet Chilli Tofu for $12.90.
  We found that the sweet chilli tofu was alright, couldn't find any special on the dish.

- Beef & Basil for $13.90.
  The beef & basil was actually pretty nice and well cooked.
  Unfortunately, it was too salty and we almost couldn't eat by itself without being accompanied by the jasmine rice to neutralise the strong taste.

- Thai Chilli Pork  for $13.90.
  The pork was served warm and had great presentation.
  Another great dish from our order, the vegetables and pork were perfectly cooked.
  The taste was absolutely great as well, it wasn't too strong.
  
Overall, the taste of the food wasn't that bad but it was pricey compared to other Thai restaurants as expected.
It was slightly disappointed by looking at the small portion of some dishes served.

Service: 3.0
Speed: 2.5
Taste: 3.0

The menu on Zomato doesn't do justice, it's one of those common print of ""not-art"", just colourful, crappy font set up with some 88 dishes that confuses diners on what they do best. It cheapened the...place, their set up and what they are offering now .... must be the previous owner, judging by the previous Zomato comments.

Thank God for the new owner and the new menu; in a binder, classier; much slimmer, simplified and still has some 55 dishes on it, they just can't help themselves in dishing out good Thai food :-).

Good, pleasant service, although they are not Thai as one Zomato reviewer suggested, quite pro-active and efficient, waitresses are all in black except the Manager/owner, so you know where to go.

Great ""timber' frontage, the interior looks bright and classy from the outside, big windows, simple, not too cluttered, wooden chairs and tables that are clothed and lined with butcher paper, nicely set up, it feels ""Thai"". Mixed and matched crockery, Thai Blue White china, standard small heavy stem wine glass, however they looked after the ladies well, they've got their Copper spoons and forks while we are getting standard stainless steel ones.

Our orders were mostly spot on, they left out the Panang Chicken Curry in the kitchen but no drama.

We've ordered their ""mini"" Krua Thai Samosa - good; Pandan Chicken - must reorder next time (one of the best in Melbourne); Chef's Special Crispy Pork Belly and Chinese Broccoli, a few tough Pork Belly with that beautiful garlicky stir-fry sauce; Massaman Beef Curry - pretty good, tender meats; Grilled Chicken, lightly marinated nicely and some Coconut rice, Jasmine and a few Roti.

My only qualm on dinner; they run out of Duck Curry at 19:40 and their dish size/portion, they were just too small, especially that Grilled Chicken.

Parking was difficult and is probably the only thing that would prevent us from going there in the near future.
Well, we've got the best table for four in the house, by the window, semi booth style.

Much improved, classier B&W Menu, good array of ""authentic"" Thai food, I just wish parking could be a lot easier, kop khun krap - JT 27/05/2017More",Date of visit: May 2017,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

There was a good crowd with chatter and laughter adding to the atmosphere.  We were served by a sweet Thai waitress who was always helpful though we...needed to repeat our order/requests a few times.

However, this does not take away the quality of experience we had there.  All the dishes we ordered were fantastic (accordingly to my young children critics) and the taste were authentic Thai.  The Pad Thai (noodles) was the most popular amongst the children and it was ""finished"" before we knew it.  We added Pad Neo (which I think is the name of the fried fish dish) and it was popular with my young kids too.  We also treated ourselves to a nice BBQ seafood (on skewers).  

No Thai meal can be complete with the Green Thai Curry (with Beef) which was not spicy and thus, even the kids love it.  For personal indulgence, I ordered a Tom Yum soup and it was full of flavour especially when it was washed down with Fragrant Thai rice.

Highly recommended.More",Date of visit: December 2015,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews as part of our industry-leading trust & safety standards. Read our transparency report to learn more.,,More

For the mains it just gets better I order the grilled chicken with special shallot sauce or the stir-fry with oyster sauce which is fantastic. 

Make sure you get coconut rice for all the sauce left over from you meal and it's some of the best coconut rice I've had.

I ordered two meals one tossed from the wok and one stir fried noodles with two satay chicken skewers totalling about...$29-.  As I patiently waited at the servers window my experience went rapidly downhill from here.

After watching numerous people being served and meals being prepared at a steady rate I looked at my watch and wondered where my meal was... 10 minutes had elapsed and I perked up with excitement when I saw part of the order placed on a tray.  As I waited for the rest of the order I watched multiple other orders sit in the service window for extended periods of time while the rest of the docket was prepared... Meanwhile single meal orders flew out the window at a rapid rate.  It was then that I noticed checks ordered twenty minutes after my order were being processed ahead of mine while half my order stood in the window getting cold. Really? After waiting 20 minutes for my order and watching the docket debacle coming from the kitchen I finally mentioned this to a female staff member and was told ""that's just the way the chef cooks things"". After explaining the issue to another staff member to their credit they re cooked the cold order and had the whole meal prepared in under a few minutes.

As a Thai food fan my expectations were high. The meal was well presented yet failed to deliver not only an authentic Thai taste but one with actual flavour. The meal was palatable, scant on beef, Thai basil and chilli. The saviour of the whole meal was the satay chicken skewers which were delicious and perfectly cooked.  Overall I doubt that I would reorder.

Dear Thailander,
If a customer orders multiple meals on a check it should ALL be sent out at the same time!! Food should NOT be left sitting in the window for the rest of the order particularly with other customers leaning across it to pick up their orders.  Speed also does not equal quality.  Readjust your processes and consider food safety.More",Date of visit: November 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I had a Green Chicken curry and prawn spring rolls which were both fantastic, very fragrant and fresh and my wife's stir fry was so good she went back to get it a few days later for take away dinner.

We went there for the first time a week or so ago and will never be going back. The food was terrible, tasted nothing like Thai food and to be...perfectly honest the flavours were like the meals were made from packets you buy at the supermarket!! Prawn spring rolls, weren't hand made, prawn crackers that were bright pink exactly like the ones you buy off the super market shelf, full of oil as for the peanut sauce foul. Mains we had Pad Thai prawn and a Penang Chicken Curry, this was like a curdled soup, not thick n creamy, was very watered down. Pad Thai was ok, but like I said nothing like what else you can get in the area. We definately won't be back, was a waste of $54.00 and spoilt our night!!!More",Date of visit: June 2013,6  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Great start with the Crispy Calamari followed by sweet spicy Tom Yum Chicken and Vegetable soup.
Green Beef Curry, Chicken Basil Stir-fry and hot steam Jasmine rice .... perfect combo.
It was a great and tasty curry, not as hot as I would expect.
The only downside of the evening is the rather bland Chicken Basil Stir-fry.

I got my meal first and it took 30 mins before he and I asked where is his meal. They finally came out with Tiger Prawns! He didn't order that meal,,,so we complained and finally they gave him a refund for the $33 for the tiger prawns and stated they only had two kitchen hands so understaffed. They said - 5 mins for Barramundi.  It looked and smelt horrible and it was crispy and dry with no curry sauce!! It was so dry and horrible and it came with some chili spicy salad. My friend struggled to eat it and left the lot.  He didn't get what he expected. Once again we complained. We left and then the waitress and the Manager I assume came out and said aren't you going to pay for the Barramundi? We showed the Manager the plate full of food uneaten and that it didn't come with a sauce and we were totally unsatisfied with the whole experience, so eventually she seemed to understand and we left accordingly. I love Thai usually, but this is not god food or service. Don't bother.More",Date of visit: July 2023,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

I come and visit as often as I can, and I always order the breakfast which is the best in the Chapel Street area, if not in all Melbourne. It...is VERY generous in size, and being a Thai breakfast, has amazing flavours (I even order the Chorizo as a side which is not Thai obviously but it is an ENTIRE Chorizo sausage!).
The problem was (as I discovered on my last visit, last week) was that they are open for breakfast - WAIT FOR IT - but don't serve breakfast before 10am!!
I was baffled, as I've had SO many breakfasts here over SO many years, yet I never remember this 10am rule!
Not to mention that no restaurant/cafe in the area would bother opening for breakfast if they don't bother offering breakfast till 10am.
What tops it for me is actually that the sign in the window offers lunch from 11am!?!

While the delivery speed was reasonable, overall the food was very average and I must say for some reason I expected better. The roti was a bit chewy and could have done with a bit more cooking. The pork spring rolls...were good, although a little dry and didnt seem to be that fresh. I also ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, fresh basil and chilli. Well let's just say the chilli was non-existent. There was a nice underlaying flavor but it there was just not enough depth to truly make this dish enjoyable. In fact, I did not finish the meal at all because it was so underwhelming. The noodles were clumpy and stuck together, there was literally one thinly sliced capsicum in the bowl (why include it at all?). It had all the makings for a good dish but just wasnt executed right at all.

Overall, it was an average meal. Apparently this place is certified as an authentic Thai restaurant by the Thai government (according to EatNow.com), however I have definitely had better elsewhere.

Unbelievable lack of care and responses when explained of eating needs?,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g1902873-d3672947-r719810918-Sunset_Thai-Altona_Hobsons_Bay_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/b8/00/dc/gjk777.jpg,gjk777,112 reviews,Reviewed 20 October 2019 ,"Unfortunately tonight MY WIFE AND I had one of our my unexpected lack of Customer Service Care and Responses in our 5 Decades of attending Restaurants across the World.  

Upon entry the Waitress was cordial and I greeted her in Thai and she responded.  There...were only only 1 couple in the entire Restaurant when we arrived, so the vast array of tables were open to our choice.

Before we went to be seated I spent some time to explain that 2 weeks previous I had had Stomach Surgery and we were down from the Country as was obvious by our Country attire along with my Akubra and in Melbourne.

I further explained I could only eat Soups and fluids, etc, but my wife obviously was fine, did they have anything without the hard ingredients , just the juices S we had had similar at other Restaurants.

The lady said the clear so should be fine so we became seated.  I even showed where the operation had be done on.my stomach/chest area to prove what I had said was correct as the conversation was quite jovial at this point.

Another lady came to serve us and I again repeated the conversation I had with the original lady and explained I just needed some soup with roughage, but obviously enough for a meal and the Clear Soup Chicken flavour was advised, so we ordered this with a Bowl of Tom Kai Gai for my wife.  

We also ordered 2 glasses of wine. 

The wine was delivered normal glasses $8.00 quite good quality.

Then the soup arrived in small entree size bowls at $9.80 each and my bowl had the entire bowl filled with vegetables and a little chicken in huge chunky pieces in a 1/3 if that of fluid of Clear Soup.

My wife's soup was exactly the same in same and components, except with the Tom Kai Hai soup mix.

Because the Restaurant was basically deserted, I had to go find a waitress and as her to come to the Table.  I had put the contents of my Entree Plate Soup on a Butter plate and showed her the entire ammoint of Clear Soup I had been served.

She immediately became very defensive and said they are running a Business and that is what you get.

I again explained I had already shared why I only needed the soup and non vegetable, etc mass and she dismissed my complaint and walked away.

I gave my wife the vegetables, etc as apparently they are very nice as was her contents of her Tom Kai Hai this is why I have rated this Restaurant 2 Stars, and I drank the 1/3 contents of Fluid from both the Entree Soup Bowl s which I must say was also very nice and would have enjoyed a Meal of either if Available, but this was not to be.

We finished and went to leave and pay.  The second Lady served me and I replayed what had happened over the Evening and even showed her also to prove that I was not able to eat Solids.

I was abruptly told I should not be going to any Restaurant to eat if I can't eat Solid food, which I found incredulous as we were 400 kms away from home in Melbourne and could only eat I  Restaurants, etc, and this was the first one after we explained before seating our plight that had acted in this manner.

Some had politely told us they couldn't assist, but others made exceptions or were able to rustle things up.  

This one obviously with so few customers simply had no care for the individual and only an eye on thefew $$ at the end of the visit.

Obviously won't be back, which is a pity as the fluid of the soup was lovely so would've been back when my Stomach was ok again in a few weeks and really sampled the menu.

Lesson needed by the Customer Service Officers, simply say NO if your not prepared to add extra water and herbs extra and increase the size of you Bowl of Soup from a Entree Size to a Normal Size in most Thai Restaurants.

The food is okay. Red curry with duck had nice flavours, and papaya salad carried a spicy kick. Staff are friendly...when they interact.

But $5 for a roti bread plus an extra $4 for peanut sauce or garlic spread? $25 for a salt and pepper calamari?

Dinner for five people cost $140 and that included a little one just having entree spring rolls and water for everyone.

2. Should we just help ourselves to a...table?
3. Should we just walk out? 
4. Who are the staff members? 
5. Do we have to approach the bench? (Where there was a s cashier standing there)
Someone finally happened to come by and say hello and asked how many will be dining. 
We were led to a table. Again sat around for a few minutes until we happened to see where the stock of menu books were. So we helped ourselves to that rather than twiddle our thumbs any longer. 

There were some dishes in the menu which interested us. So we ordered 3 entrees (spring rolls x2 serves & small soup) and X1 main (beef, veg and cashew nuts), X11 glass of sparkling white wine and X1 glass of coke. All this costed high $70s

Quality of food was very low. The main was served on a sizzling plate that I never heard or saw sizzle. The food on it was already jelling on the plate. The soup was ok. Spring rolls were ok too. But not value for money. Quantity is reasonable.

Outstanding Thai in the most unexpected place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g255100-d2419284-r121345338-Tasty_Thai-Melbourne_Victoria.html,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/27/5b/fc/gordaus.jpg,Gordaus,14 reviews,Reviewed 3 December 2011 ,"You would think that with the number of Thai restaurants in Melbourne that it would be easy to find a decent Thai Green Chicken Curry.  For many westerners it is the first Thai dish they had and with its use of favours from Kaffir Lime...leaves, galangal and lemon grass it is, for many of us, the signature dish for the whole cuisine.   So it is disappointing that most Thai restaurants in Melbourne either can't be bothered adding those aromatics or drown them in suffocating coconut creme.   
I therefore did not expect much when I pulled up to a lunch stand at the QV market with a hankering for Thai: the Tasty Thai and ordered Green Chicken Curry.   What a pleasant surprise.
The dish was simple as you would expect with a lunch stand: a plate of rice and a bowl of curry.  The flavours of the curry did high fives on my palate just as Thai curry (or indeed any Thai dish) is supposed to do.  The chicken was juicy and there were tasty bamboo shoots to add texture.  My wife was the first person in the world to discover that zucchini is an outstanding addition to Asian  stir-frys so I was astounded to find zucchini here.  
All up it cost A$9 bucks and was worth every penny.  I'd like to try it with a papaya salad and a pino grigio as part of a dinner some day.  As it is there are far worse ways to have lunch in Melbourne.More",Date of visit: November 2011,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

As a frequent visitor to Thailand for the past 25 years I am of course a lover of Thai food and I...can honestly say this is one of the first Thai restaurants that I have eaten at in Melbourne where the food tastes authentic. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive and the owner/chef, unlike many Melbourne restaurants, will eagerly prepare dishes that are not on the menu. We have eaten there twice in the past 2 weeks and on our first visit we mentioned that one of our favourite dishes was Som tum (green Papaya salad). On our second visit the chef had pre purchased the green Papaya and made the dish especially for us. The portions are generous and well priced by Melbourne standards and the food arrives in the typical Thai style of 1 dish at a time. well woth a visit.

You need to be unable to ascend to the 1st floor where the restaurant is, but once you are there the...food makes climbing the stairs well worthwhile.

Unfortunately, our waiter had quite an amount of difficulty with the language difficulties between English and Thai, nevermind, we were able to successfully negotiate this problem. However, it is preferable not to have to go through this at the start of a meal as it can make the situation uncomfortable.

When we eventually got our meals, not surprisingly, it all arrived in a bit of a rush, something that I have found disappointing with many Chinese and Asian restaurants - the food gets cold whilst you are taking your time over dinner and enjoying it.

We had a variety of dishes from a curry which was absolutely delightful through to other meals based on chicken, beef, and seafood. None were heavily over spiced, and the coconut rice was delicious. We could not fault the food. Even the deserts were very pleasant indeed and did not disappoint.

A word about the service - it leaves so much to be desired - the restaurant lets itself down so badly by the lack of attention to the service. We had completed our main courses; there was no attempt to remove the serving plates, etc after 30 min - which is excessive. Eventually, after catching the eye of the infrequent waiter service to our area, the plates were removed. A desert menu was then presented and following some interpretation difficulties, deserts were finally served.

Pricing is reasonable considering the standard of food that you get. Most of the mains are around $20 per serving. Deserts are between $6 - $10.

Drinks are also reasonable, although the soft drinks are somewhat on the high side.

Would we go back? If I could be guaranteed the service had improved I would have absolutely no problem going back. However, in the circumstances we found during this visit, there is no excuse for really poor service - we will not be going back.More",Date of visit: September 2011,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The restaurant was dimly lit which reminiscent to the Bangkok Sukhumvit local food. The dinner menu was resonably priced. We've ordered the Thai Fried Chicken, Seafood Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad Thai Fried Noodles. The  Fried Chicken was hot,...spicy and full of favour. The only down side was it had far too much flour...... Otherwise, it coud be a perfect dish. The Pad Thai noodle lacked seasoning and was rather ordinary and sad. The worst one was the Seafood Fried Rice with the Calamari which tasted like rubber with an extremely foul smell. We just couldn't eat it..... All in all, a very ordinary dinner which could be so much bettter if the chef put his heart to cook. Simple is beautiful..... If only he can put in more effort, use fresh ingredients, the outcook will be far more pleasant and rewarding.More",Date of visit: April 2019,2  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Pad Thai Prawns, missing that gravy wetness and fish sauce saltines 6/10. They've got the crushed peanuts not dry chillies.

Massaman Beef Curry, meat was tough and missing that spice kick, although balance Coconut milk.

We had Tom Yum soup which was delicious and not too spicy (I don't really like my food too hot). Then we were served several entrees which included chicken satay sticks,...spring rolls, samosas which were all tasty and the satay sauce was thick and delicious.
We had a choice of two mains and chose the chicken satay (as most of the others were hot), and my partner had the pad thai which he enjoyed. The chicken satay was enjoyable. We were also served rice but couldn't eat it all. Then came a delightful little dessert of coconut ice cream and jelly in little cups. They were very nice to finish off the meal but we were extremely full when we left.
The service was extremely courteous and friendly and the Asian pop playing in the back ground leant to the atmosphere, the décor of this place is funky and quite quirky.
They had some lovely sounding specials of lunches for ten dollars for some soup, a main and a drink which sounded very nice.
Not a five star establishment but I would certainly eat there again as it was quick and a nice place to sit and watch the world go by.More",Date of visit: February 2015,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Second time I had pad Thai- worst pad Thai I ever tasted. 
I gave it one more chance and ordered Singapore noodles it was absolutely terrible saturated in what  tasted like cheap oil with a touch of oyster sauce. I told the waitress and she didn’t understand a word of English and walked away and started speaking to another waitress in her language.

Parked at the rear and the entrance was a beautiful walk of greenery. Thought that was nice. Restaurant itself is off the main road but it’s pretty quiet inside. 
We ordered the Satay which I though was...good. Not your usual Malaysian satay, there’s a difference with Thai satay. 
Traditional duck curry and deep fried fish with Thai sauce I thought was ok. Thinly sliced duck meat in a curry was good but lack the punch and meat. Fish was good. Sweet sour and a lil tangy sauce goes well. Service was good being that it’s Friday night and lots of take away orders.

We we're delighted with how the placed looked like and how the waiters were dressed. Completely like you were in a...decent Thai Resto. It's just that the food tasted average compare to the local that resto we dined before. It's lacking of that Thai rich flavour taste for the sauted beef. Also, the satay sauce looked flour-ish and not creamy (as it's suppose to be because it's a peanut sauce). However, the Pad See Ewe was the winner of that night. That was the only menu we loved amongst the 3 that we ordered. Would like to give it a try again for their fish and curry menus.

But this time we had a booking for 14 diners (family and friends) to celebrate an 18th birthday on a...Monday night.

Everyone arrived on time only to find the place in complete darkness. They had changed their days of operation but completely neglected to honour the booking or advise of their change. We had left two phone numbers for contact purposes. 

Chaos ensued. The night could have been a total disaster.

Luckily the Cross Keys came to the rescue and could accommodate us, but we could not be more disappointed with Nongkhai Thai. Maybe they simply failed to check their bookings at all. Even a call on the day would have allowed some changes to be made. Unforgivable for a local restaurant to simply ignore a big booking.

Would normally give them 4 stars for food, beverages, service. Now I can't recommend them at all. We'll never go again, and will encourage others to dine elsewhere.More",Date of visit: June 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Just An Average Thai Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g2019289-d5102201-r381025995-Nongkhai_Thai_Restaurant-Essendon_Moonee_Valley_Greater_Melbourne_Victoria.html,"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==",eggshellblonde2014,183 reviews,Reviewed 9 June 2016 ,"My wife and I have lived in the area for 8 years and decided that we should have a mid week meal there. We thought it's been trading for maybe as long as 20 years so it must be good.

First impressions were very good,...a nicely appointed Thai Restaurant with friendly staff all looking very smart in their Thai outfits.

After a look at the menu a very friendly young waiter took down our order and returned with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc that we ordered.

My wife and I shared an appetiser of 4 curry puffs, unfortunately they were very small, had virtually no filling, it was difficult to find the minced chicken, potato or onion and they were overcooked.

We then ordered a serve of stuffed roti rolls (2 per serve) to share and we received 2 serves of roti rolls (4 roti rolls in total). They were quite nice and so we let the error go by without commenting.

For our main course we ordered one Mussaman Curry with chicken and a serve of steamed rice for two.

We subsequently received 2 separate Mussaman Curry meals served in very nice little clay pots, but again 2 meals instead of one.

I wanted to return the second meal but my wife didn't want to make a fuss and so we ate one of the meals, which was only of average standard, the curry sauce was nice but not sure where they sourced the chicken.

They offered to put the second uneaten meal into a ""doggie bag"" as we used to call them but as we didn't enjoy it we declined.

The cost of the meals was $104 and an extra $30 for the Four Sisters Sauvignon Blanc, about a 100% mark up, made it an expensive meal.

The service was polite and friendly but unprofessional in that on two separate occasions they served 2 meals when we had only ordered one.

I don't think that we'll be returning soon.More",Date of visit: June 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Now in new premises two doors up from the former location. The design and decor is wonderful with a very relaxing and pleasant water feature and greenery.

However something seems to have gone wrong with the...staff and food.

My wife had a variety of entrees for dinner, each one looked like they were factory made packet frozen products heated in an oven and served with some limp vegetable garnishes. The giveaway was the bright food-dye markings and the regularity of machine shapes.

I ordered the Grilled Chicken with Spicy Green Papaya Salad (Gai Yang Som Tum) that I enjoyed so much previously. This time, the chicken was not grilled, instead it was pan fried, oily and devoid of flavour. I mentioned this to the waitress who simply shrugged her shoulders and offered to make something else. I couldn't see the point as it was highly unlikely that a new dish would come even close to the description or be satisfying.

At least the bill was accurate.More",Date of visit: February 2014,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You are able to have a dish with up to 5 different varieties of main components.
We had a variety of entrees which were very tasty and of average Thai restaurant size.
All the mains that we had were of very good sizes and very filling, indeed.
Looked like a husband and wife team with hubby cooking and the lady serving.
It is not licensed so we took some BYO drinks and the children were catered for with standard soft drinks.
The freshness of the food can through and all our group were very satisfied with the meal.
Apart from the preparations, all went rather well.More",Date of visit: October 2015,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The restaurant opened around mid year and provides a nice alternative in terms of what's available in the area.
The food is very good, the dishes we selected on our visits were all...full of flavour, and compared very well with other Thai restaurants we have visited. Service has improved since opening, and prices are quite reasonable. They do take away, which seemed very popular on the two occasions we were there. Also BYO. All in all, a nice place to have an inexpensive meal.More",Date of visit: June 2016,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It is decorated in a restrained manner with tall wide windows facing the street.

I have purchased take-away food several times from here.

My wife loved the Tom Kha soup.
The kids enjoyed the Satay Chicken....I have had the Gaeng Massamun Neur (curry) several times. The meat breaks apart easily and has a wonderful flavour. There is plenty of potato, onions and peanuts.

The first time I came here was shortly after they opened. Thankfully the front of house issues have been solved by relegating the men back to the kitchen whilst the ladies take care of the customers.

The food is authentic, well prepared and has good flavour.
The take-away containers are thoughtfully sealed by cling wrap.More",Date of visit: June 2016,1  ,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

In general the food was a very high standard and reasonably priced as well.  One negative is its fully licensed, so no...BYO anything. But their drink prices weren't over priced, so its no big deal.  But don't expect an extensive wine list, because its pretty basic. 

The table service wasn't the best experience I've had, with the waitress rather rudely asking us to hurry up and order.  After we placed our orders we found the waiting time for our first course to be excessive.  You'd like to think that this wasn't pay back for the waitress waiting for our order.  However there seemed to be more urgency placed on the phone orders and pickups by on foot customers than that of the eat in customers like us which probably explained our long wait.  But when the food arrived, it was really good, so all was forgotten. 

So if you're not in a hurry and want to have a relaxing meal, then by all means eat here as the food it very good indeed and good value as well.More",Date of visit: October 2013,,This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
